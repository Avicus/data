{"username":"15soccergoalie","about":"Heyo! If you see me playing feel free to say hi! I love sports and playing MC (duh). If I am not playing MC then I am probably outside playing sports, hanging out with my friends, and/or reading. I have been playing the violin since I was four. I have trouble keeping my hands still, so I took up drumming also! I am not a nerd (hopefully). I have a black belt in Martial Arts (not lying for all you haters out there :P). I have one bassett hound puppy named Fletcher, he turned one on September 5. I am not really good at writing about myself :/. Sadly, I won't be able to play much during the school year with sports and class :(. I will try to play as much as I can! See you on Avicus! biiiiiiiiiii\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- Page Views!!! --\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.e-zeeinternet.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.e-zeeinternet.com/count.php?page=1060605\u0026style=LED_g\u0026nbdigits=5\" alt=\"Free Counters\" border=\"0\" \u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.e-zeeinternet.com/\" title=\"Free Counters\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;\"\u003eFree Counters\u003c/a\u003e\u003c!-- Counter Code END --\u003e","interests":"soccer, lacrosse, tennis, basketball, shooting real guns and bows, and reading ","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[{"color":"#14BB06","text_color":"#FFFFFF","text":"Emerald"}],"total_kills":"10,539","total_deaths":"10,023","total_pvp_deaths":"9,264","kd":"1.05","pvp_kd":"1.14","credits":"4,637","time":"8 days","joins":"414","created_at":"2013/11/02 17:06:29 +0000","created_at_human":"November  2, 2013 at  5:11 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"115","Controls":"28","Wins":"2"},"friends":[{"id":161476,"username":"Junr","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cddcbae20d91113c7013149149c87241?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true}]}
