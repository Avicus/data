{"username":"Saplix","about":"Hello Avicus staff, thank you so much for taking your time to read this. I'd like to tell the truth and that is I've been banned Avicus two times total. As well as a couple mutes and smaller punishments like capital letter usage and typing too much in a limited amount of time. Both bans were about the same reason but the permanent ban was more than one year ago in Summer 2016. As this has been already been one year, I've had the time to think how I used nasty words at the opposite team when I was in a bad position. I understand I can't do this because these words have a bad history and the people on the server are a community who work together. To have me bring that negativity to their server is not fair. In the past, I shared this unique server with all of my friends and it grew to become one of my favorites. So when appealed, I hope to begin playing Destroy The Monument with my friends again and making the server more lively. If you decide not to appeal my ban, I understand because of my history dealing with losses inappropriately. Although I would be disappointed to have waited a long time and be rejected. Why did I wait so long to appeal my ban? Well, the thing is I've been busy with school and am glad to say I've made it into freedom. Once again thank you so much if you've read this ban appeal because it means a lot to me. Happy Thanksgiving!
