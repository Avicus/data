{"username":"MiniAdetola","about":"Hai! My name is David Adetola,I am 13 years old, and I live in Canada. Nice to meet you, I was introduced to Avicus by my friend Kaius (miiniicooper), I saw him playing with his friend Sam (SlimeKiller50) and I got quickly interested it, I asked him for the IP, I was so amazed by DTM that you can Fight, Defend, Build, and other stuff, on most of the servers I went on before I can fight but not place blocks and stuff just like in DTM. DTM was my very first game in Avicus, and Walls was the secondary game, DTM is like CTF but its more fun because you can place blocks,  mine, level up and stuff, and its more fun, but there is more hackers in DTM than CTF... unfortunately. Anyways, I do play other minigames rather than DTM, like, Survival Games, Build It, Minefighter, and Footcube, ( like Football). And 1 day I wish I could become a Moderator because I believe I would be a good one because I am nice to other people and can help them. If you see me on DTM, feel free to say hi! :D","gender":"Male","interests":"Football (soccer), Scary Games, Cars, Minecraft, other video games like FIFA, Call of Duty","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"2,051","total_deaths":"3,026","total_pvp_deaths":"2,467","kd":"0.68","pvp_kd":"0.83","credits":"4,442","time":"6 days","joins":"264","created_at":"2013/11/11 00:57:19 +0000","created_at_human":"November 11, 2013 at 12:11 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"26"},"friends":[]}
