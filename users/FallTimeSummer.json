{"username":"FallTimeSummer","about":"Hai :3\r\nMy name is Ellz, yeah. My username will be changed to Ellz42 once Mojang gets around to doing that ._.\r\nI am awesome. Yes, you were right.\r\nI've played MC for 5-ish years, I think... I was like 8 when I made this profile, hence having the world's most babyish username. Although girls DO rule.\r\nOk, I'll admit it. I've been tempbanned. It was for Excessive Caps, which is completely unfair, since I am an artist, and since there's also no Italics, Caps are the easiest way to attract attention/express your point. Caps should not be bannable, unless in a spam context, in which that IS fair.\r\nI'm bored...\r\nFavourite Emoji: xD which is closely followed by :D\r\nI only play Nebula, and I prefer TDM to DTM.\r\nIgnore my infractions, I'm really just excitable, sassy and immature. I'll wisen up if you give me an important job.","gender":"Female","interests":"Minecraft, writing, art, singing, dancing, shopping, normal stuff.","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"1,725","total_deaths":"3,697","total_pvp_deaths":"3,268","kd":"0.47","pvp_kd":"0.53","credits":"347","time":"4 days","joins":"86","created_at":"2013/11/03 01:41:11 +0000","created_at_human":"November  3, 2013 at  1:11 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"14","Controls":"1"},"friends":[]}
