I get along with most ppl, except for freakin' spawn killers, I hate them -_-\r\nhate.....them. WHY? Because one day I was minding my own biz when along came 6 spawn killers going at me all match until I got saved when they got kicked. That's my story. They got like ALOT of kills out of me......alot.         \r\n\r\n\r\n^-^ luv ya","gender":"Female","interests":"Drawing, PVP","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"1,630","total_deaths":"3,184","total_pvp_deaths":"3,122","kd":"0.51","pvp_kd":"0.52","credits":"1,085","time":"2 days","joins":"663","created_at":"2013/12/06 03:30:27 +0000","created_at_human":"December  6, 2013 at  3:12 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"3","Controls":"81"},"friends":[]}
