{"username":"DiviXion","about":"\u003ch1\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cb\u003eHey! It's DiviXion here! I've started to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) now! I am currently inactive on Minecraft and most other games.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cfont color=\"0033CC\"\u003eAs you can see, my IGN is DiviXion. I've been playing Minecraft ever since 1.3.2 and I haven't exactly stopped since then. I started on a cracked account but being the 12vie I was, I got my whole country banned on that server. Then I moved over to Shotbow and enjoyed my time there since 2012. Not long after that, I met OCN and I played there. Along those 2, I found many more servers but not as engaging as those 2.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ccenter\u003eI ended up quitting OCN about a year ago and around mid-2014, I started playing League of Legends. Being an Australian, I played on the OCE server and enjoyed my time. From being a complete noob buying full items without buying the smaller ones first to playing extremely well by getting used to a whole ton of mechanics. Although, I quit Minecraft for the time-being, I took a 3 month break for the Summer of 2014-2015. I took some breaks in between but those are minor. I rarely ever spend a full hour on Minecraft now and I'm in my 2nd last year of high school so times are getting tougher.\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ccenter\u003eWhen I came back to Minecraft (a small period of time though), I played on a server called Desteria. It's a fun faction server with a unique aspect to it but I have recently went inactive there and on every Minecraft server. Sadly, the hit detection there is garbage so I can't play there properly anyways. Not too long ago, I found myself playing Avicus again and here I am. I'm starting to play here more often but I'm not sure how long I will stay for. It could be a while or it could be a small amount of time. It doesn't matter how long I stay here for but I think it's how much fun I have here.\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ccenter\u003eDuring my recent months of Minecraft, I do play some highly competitive PvP servers, such as Kohi and Badlion. I mostly stick to Badlion because I love their AU server and I feel more supportive of them rather than Kohi. My ELO is not that great on Badlion but I think I'm above average anyways. If you ever want to talk to me, just hit me up via Steam (as long as you're not a Level 0 or 1 or a Private Profile) or Inbox me here (if you can). Other than that, let's hope we can get to know each other :)\u003ccenter\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ca href=\"http://avicus.net/forums/b9bf30c5e\"\u003e\u003ccenter\u003eI also made a re-introduction so if you want to see it, just click anywhere on this sentence.\u003c/center\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/XYKB8Jq\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XYKB8Jq.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://info.flagcounter.com/xxVs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s10.flagcounter.com/count/xxVs/bg_000000/txt_FFFFFF/border_CCC237/columns_5/maxflags_30/viewers_Profile+Stalkers/labels_0/pageviews_1/flags_0/\" alt=\"Flag Counter\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img.10fastfingers.com/badge/typing-test_1_DG.png\" alt=\"Typing Test\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/center\u003e","gender":"Male","interests":"CS:GO, Sleep, Food","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"1,737","total_deaths":"1,397","total_pvp_deaths":"1,140","kd":"1.24","pvp_kd":"1.52","credits":"3,073","time":"1 day","joins":"121","created_at":"2014/03/03 02:01:58 +0000","created_at_human":"March  3, 2014 at  2:03 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"113","Controls":"14","Wools":"1"},"friends":[{"id":3211,"username":"Zedther","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8788a0350bbb11f2d3d469c3fd1edca5?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},{"id":4479,"username":"Riskayyy","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b7153466dc6a08f9f2ee06648e9c440c?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":69284,"username":"iiDarudePvP","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9c65f16fc2d44bc8aee1ef0b99ef8f96?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},{"id":223106,"username":"Porkyyy","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/028806860da44ac3a62343369c73afb1?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},{"id":302583,"username":"Teemobile","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72eb4bb08bcf43e34a13255bcbb0f6f2?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":312304,"username":"Jahaj","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/afc67e5d2a82a5f416a6211a43f19ce4?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false}]}
