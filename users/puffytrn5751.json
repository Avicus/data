{"username":"puffytrn5751","about":"Hey :) So, I have decided that it is time that I left minecraft as a whole.  I used to be able to play and have time with my friends, family, etc. However, the more time I spent outside of the gaming world, the more I noticed how much I loved being around the ones I love.  I wanted to say thank you to all of those who have made me happy and made me want to stick around for a fairly long time.  But, a special thanks to PokerFace_Legend, Zaidms0987(Yusuf), jakesandobal, Rey_Gordo6, Snowcone202, Sabenza21, PandaDarkness, ghostrider_200, and nikkiice12. As for everyone else, thank you for being my friends and making Avicus an amazing community.  I love you all and thank you soooo much\u003c3","gender":"Female","interests":"add me on snapchat!(: @puffyjordyn","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"6,378","total_deaths":"9,950","total_pvp_deaths":"8,502","kd":"0.64","pvp_kd":"0.75","credits":"243","time":"20 days","joins":"588","created_at":"2014/02/15 20:55:01 +0000","created_at_human":"February 15, 2014 at  8:02 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"239","Wins":"1","Controls":"1"},"friends":[{"id":19112,"username":"Numberz_","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/e16d067223c74a02bd22965e38521c35?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":215946,"username":"PokerFace","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2124417da55a6c5feacfe0c5b4b9bc0?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true}]}
