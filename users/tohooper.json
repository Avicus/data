{"username":"tohooper","about":"Hi, my name (I guess you could say IGN) is tohooper.  I mostly play Nebula. I would like to murder spleefers, because they only make your free time (which can be very limited) unbelievably  miserable. I love this server. It is probably the second best server I have ever played on. The first I will not name because I would most likely be deleted from this website (and I don't think it is still up and running anyways) but my favorite server ever was the first one I ever played mine craft on. If you are trying to find my real name, I can not help you. But the only thing I know about myself is that I think I live somewhere in Oklahoma.","gender":"Male","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[{"color":"#14BB06","text_color":"#FFFFFF","text":"Emerald"}],"total_kills":"1,999","total_deaths":"2,656","total_pvp_deaths":"2,131","kd":"0.75","pvp_kd":"0.94","credits":"2,835","time":"about 23 hours","joins":"58","created_at":"2013/12/26 20:39:07 +0000","created_at_human":"December 26, 2013 at  8:12 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"14"},"friends":[]}
