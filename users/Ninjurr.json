I only play every now and then and very casually, so I don't play as well as I used to. If you need to contact me you can do so in game, or you could click on my Youtube link and PM me on there. \u003c3\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003chr width=\"60%\" color=\"#0101DF\"\u003e\r\n\u003cu\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy have I been inactive?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003c/u\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eThe answer to this is I have been very bored of Minecraft lately. I guess I just played way too much of it, and it got to a very repetitive point. I started to play other games, such as RuneScape. Also, my friend got falsely banned(he isn't even aloud to get texture packs, how would he be aloud to get hacks), so I haven't had anyone to play with, and playing solo for me isn't as fun as with friends. #FreeHoboChaos2015.\r\n\u003ch2\u003eProfile views!\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv align='center'\u003e\u003cimg src='http://www.hit-counts.com/counter.php?t=1304337' border='0' alt='Web Counter' /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e","gender":"Male","interests":"Nebula, Runescape","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"5,792","total_deaths":"2,685","total_pvp_deaths":"2,424","kd":"2.16","pvp_kd":"2.39","credits":"135","time":"2 days","joins":"113","created_at":"2013/11/02 20:43:00 +0000","created_at_human":"November  2, 2013 at  8:11 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"24"},"friends":[]}
