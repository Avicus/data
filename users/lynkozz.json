{"username":"lynkozz","about":"Level 40 on Nebula! Level 35 on The Walls! I am a gamer who mostly plays minecraft. The servers I mostly play are Avicus, Simply Crafted, and Hypixel. I am a skilled mapmaker so ask me if you want help making a map. I have been playing minecraft since October 2011 and bought it in May 2012. I have made many maps on xbox and am making a map on pc right now (probably finished by December). I make youtube videos but have not been active lately.","gender":"Male","interests":"Music, Videogames, PC, Mac, xbox, playstation, Nintendo, Minecraft, Skyrim, COD, Assassins Creed","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"5,527","total_deaths":"6,611","total_pvp_deaths":"5,955","kd":"0.84","pvp_kd":"0.93","credits":"4,138","time":"9 days","joins":"529","created_at":"2013/11/07 15:11:40 +0000","created_at_human":"November  7, 2013 at  3:11 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"18","Wins":"44","Controls":"89","Wools":"1"},"friends":[]}
