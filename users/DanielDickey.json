{"username":"DanielDickey","about":"Hey. My name is Daniel Dickey, but when I made my account, like, 5 years ago, my mom set it as as her name Tina. thus birthing tdickey. We didn't know that was the display name, so... yeah. I've been on roughly a year but just made an account recently. I'm 14, live in the now freezing state of Maine, and am possibly irrationally obsessed with this server. I am yet to improve on my PvP skillz. My KTD ratio is about half. I die twice for every one kill. I'm just too good a guy to ruthlessly kill everyone without hesitation... (that's my current excuse at the moment). Find me online sometime, we'll game it up.","gender":"Male","interests":"Video games, (cause Skyrim is bae). I like writing, theatre, and art. I love reading as well.","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"606","total_deaths":"1,226","total_pvp_deaths":"995","kd":"0.49","pvp_kd":"0.61","credits":"22","time":"1 day","joins":"61","created_at":"2013/12/22 16:05:52 +0000","created_at_human":"December 22, 2013 at  4:12 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Wins":"1","Controls":"8"},"friends":[]}
