{"username":"Whatevr4eva","about":"'Ello! I may live in the US but im actually Canadian. :D . My nicknames are: | halt | halting | drake | My favirote Minecraft hobbies are... In my intrests so yeah, read dat, my life hobbies are: Reading | Swimming | Watching Football (I like da Patriots) | Reading Creepypastas (Dont Worry! Pastas down jump out at you!)  I play ALOT of games but here are a sample: ROBLOX, haltingdrak | Minecraft, XxhaltingdrakexX | Call of Duty, haltingdrak | RIFT, Matix, Frankililing and Mivreck ( I dont play this anymore), Forge of Empires, Lapis City (I dont play this anymore). Oh and you might ask, What does \"haltingdrake\" mean? Well it all started with ROBLOX when I was about 9 and couldn't spell \"drake\" which I thought meant dragon \u003e_\u003e but drak (Thats how I spelt it) was already taken so it suggested Stupiddrak, dumbdrak, awesomedrak, drake14 but then there was haltingdrak. So I chose that and now its my username WORLDWIDE. Ok Enough about me! I want to play some Nebula!","gender":"Male","interests":"Exploring In Minecraft, Making Parkour Maps (To Be Honest They Suuuuuuuck), ","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"289","total_deaths":"1,075","total_pvp_deaths":"886","kd":"0.27","pvp_kd":"0.33","credits":"200","time":"1 day","joins":"106","created_at":"2014/02/10 08:31:39 +0000","created_at_human":"February 10, 2014 at  8:02 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"1"},"friends":[]}
