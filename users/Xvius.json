{"username":"Xvius","about":"Hello guys, my in-game-name is Noarion. My real name is Noa. Nice to meet you guys.\r\nYou guys don't know much about me so let me tell you my little story.\r\nI was born on 1997, November 7th at Tokyo, Japan. I lived in Japan for a while (7 years) but my father had his work moved to New York, America so I needed to go stay there. It was some hard time learning English for the first few years. I tend to get it and was getting better. When 8 years had past, I came back to Japan and I am studying to get a good grade in high school. I am still afraid that I might lose English in 5 years because there are not much time to speak English in Japan.\r\nThis is kind of about it for how my life turned out so far.\r\n\r\nAbout Minecraft....\r\nWell, fortunately when I was still 14, my friend apparently requested me to play a game called \"Minecraft\" (which is what I am playing). At first I wondered why would people buy this lazy game? I could have given my account to somebody else. But there was, a multiplayer zone. I created my own server for just a fun server for people to free build on. That time, multiplayer wasn't so popular and developed. Up to 20-30 players had joined my server. I could feel really happy and fun. Minecraft was so interesting. I had played it for a while when such a great server appeared on the website. (This server) I knew I found the first developed server. It was nice to play at. I became to realize that Minecraft is such an honorable game.... Well for me it is. (You might think me as weird on that part). But anyways, I really like Minecraft and the server.\r\nThis is finally about it for my discussion. Thanks for reading all this. Now sit back and rest. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n- Noarion\r\n????????????? ]????????\r\n????????????????\r\nI???????????????????].\r\n???????????????\r\n","gender":"Male","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"10,046","total_deaths":"6,364","total_pvp_deaths":"5,652","kd":"1.58","pvp_kd":"1.78","credits":"1,300","time":"6 days","joins":"588","created_at":"2013/11/03 04:19:13 +0000","created_at_human":"November  3, 2013 at  4:11 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"67","10 Killss":"1","Controls":"32","Wools":"3","Hills":"21","Flags":"2"},"friends":[{"id":58815,"username":"Da_cake_dood","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/8befb9ae67324fd38295a4960db0b40d?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":150062,"username":"cellish","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/50a34639abb34cf1b182204756c49f49?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},{"id":279591,"username":"Lightmag3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/e955f6bce3a64df7b166650155d8dc98?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":310662,"username":"DaFrozenBlaze","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6fb20a2427f9448d8a77e460c5717481?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":317437,"username":"MasterProX","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/bcf95e1b51654b77b93b17649afa425e?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},{"id":431903,"username":"Neptoon","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/35087d3902af4f60910cbdffeafa3b86?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":451714,"username":"ref","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/bd133f12724a4ca9af7bf808810aa835?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},{"id":508482,"username":"joelous","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/ba601988d27b4349ae154b0a1424bfa8?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true}]}
