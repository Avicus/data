{"username":"Philrow27","about":"Hey there! How's a goin? I'm Phil. Just to set the record straight, my real name is\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eNOT\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e Phil. I got the name from a movie script I wrote a while back, Philbert Rowanson. I also had a YouTube channel going on for awhile, but I stopped posting videos. My real identity is Matt McKinley, age 14, born and raised in Reno, Nevada, U.S.A. I'm currently in 9th grade and for the most part, I keep my grades up. I play the double bass and take all honors classes and I've gotten only one B in citizenship throughout my whole schooling carreer (stupid Spanish class). Anyways, I've played on Avicus since it got changed from MCZone, and I'd played on MCZone for as long as I can remember how to punch trees. I am currently awaiting my application for either approval or denial, so right now I'm just an average Joe who wants to get in some good Minecraftin'.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee ya later!","gender":"Male","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"387","total_deaths":"506","total_pvp_deaths":"437","kd":"0.76","pvp_kd":"0.89","credits":"0","time":"31 minutes","joins":"4","created_at":"2013/11/02 16:50:16 +0000","created_at_human":"November  2, 2013 at  4:11 PM UTC","objective_data":{},"friends":[]}
