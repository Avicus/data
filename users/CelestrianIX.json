{"username":"CelestrianIX","about":"Just a guy into gaming. xD feel free to add me on Skype, just be sure to include your username in the invite. Normally you'll find me playing Control the Hill or Nexus. Every now and then I'll be on Nebula with a friend or two of mine. I'm not one to start arguments and I try to avoid making enemies, but you'll have to answer to me if you pick on me or my friends.
