{"username":"San_David","about":"Hey everybody. Assuming that you're looking for me, San_David (a.k.a. Davidan13), I'm afraid to say that I've left the Avicus building. To be honest, I'm just not interested in PvP anymore, as I've found another aspect of Minecraft that I enjoy more. I may check the forums every now and then, and maybe PvP, but... I'm not really into it much anymore. See you all some other day.
