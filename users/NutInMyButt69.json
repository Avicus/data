{"username":"NutInMyButt69","about":"Hey guys, my name is Tanny_The_Panda, obviously :]. I have been playing avicus for about a year now and I have improved my pvp skills a lot in that time. I have enjoyed the challenge of trying to be in the top 100 on the server and so far I am like 82 or something like that. I mainly enjoy nexus and nebula because they are constant pvp games with no slow parts of searching for ppl to demolish. So have a nice day, kill ya later on avic.\r\n Other interests: Soccer, basketball, did I mention showers? ya I think I did. B-girls, [do not look that up or any thing relating to that if you are under 10. cleaning up kills, reking kids in pvp, tv shows, and life in general, [did I already say that?] well maybe I did. Anyway have a nice day random citizens of the internet and I will c u later. Ps I am not a donator. I should really quit this game and go get a life but its so much fun :], I am like the 20th best nexus player and I am not a donater.","gender":"Male","interests":"girls, showers, girls in showers, nexus, swag, life, How i met you mother.","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"47,375","total_deaths":"20,750","total_pvp_deaths":"20,433","kd":"2.28","pvp_kd":"2.32","credits":"3,015","time":"14 days","joins":"778","created_at":"2013/12/15 19:20:29 +0000","created_at_human":"December 15, 2013 at  7:12 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Controls":"39","Monuments":"47","10 Killss":"312","25 Killss":"15"},"friends":[]}
