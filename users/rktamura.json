(Many people say I have only differential equations and particles in my head, and absolutely no common sense.)\r\n\r\nI'm terrible in sports or any physical activity.\r\n\r\nMember of the physics club in my school.\r\n\r\nAn enthusiast of horology. I have a Montblanc and Omega. My dream watch would be a Patek Philippe Grande Complication. (Minimum of 250,000 dollars)\r\n\r\nA retard in social activity and social standings. (I failed the common sense and social cues in my i.q test.)\r\n\r\nI am now learning differential calculus (easy calculus) and complex mathematics for the funs!!!","gender":"Male","interests":"Quantum Field Theory/Astrophysics","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"5,863","total_deaths":"5,193","total_pvp_deaths":"4,036","kd":"1.13","pvp_kd":"1.45","credits":"0","time":"about 6 hours","joins":"36","created_at":"2013/11/30 02:39:04 +0000","created_at_human":"November 30, 2013 at  2:11 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"6"},"friends":[]}
