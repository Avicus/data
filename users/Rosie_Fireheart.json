{"username":"Rosie_Fireheart","about":"I am a girl who loves playing Minecraft with my friends. I like the old school, classy games like the Survival Games and Nebula, and I love talking to people. Be friendly! I hate it when people are disrespectful, and I love it when people talk and get creative and work together on games. I don't get much time to play on Minecraft nowdays, but when I can, you better bet that I will. My good friends are BazookaSean1311, SuperBrandi811, and Sarpagion.
