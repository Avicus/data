{"username":"Shadow_Dragon29","about":"Hi! I'm Shadow_Dragon29\r\nHere is some things about me:\r\n I'm from the U.S. I am also a girl. *gasps* I'm in middle school. My birth stone is garnet and my zodiac sign is Aquarius. I only really have one \"best\" friend. My best friend on minecraft is @Maddyb1122. (she is also my best friend in real life) I'm not a girly girl but I'm not a tom boy either. I just really hate school....   I love animals, dogs are my favorite.  I play minecraft.(obviously) See me on Nebula on Avicus. My favorite Nebula maps are Castle Adventure and Luar! I'm good at melee fighting but I'm great with a bow. My nickname on minecraft is Shad. Other than minecraft, I love to do art especially drawing. I love dragons! (that explains my username)  Team iPhone! Come meet me on nebula! I want to KILL you. jk  See ya!\r\n\r\n-Shad \r\n                               ","gender":"Female","interests":"minecraft :p, lacrosse, animals,drawing,skiing,swimming","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"4,358","total_deaths":"1,741","total_pvp_deaths":"1,455","kd":"2.5","pvp_kd":"3.0","credits":"0","time":"3 days","joins":"116","created_at":"2013/11/02 20:12:24 +0000","created_at_human":"November  2, 2013 at  8:11 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"8"},"friends":[]}
