{"username":"fluffy56547","about":"I am , well first of all a person, a person who loves minecraft. I enjoy PVP , yet sometimes my little brother, funkey87, uses my account and he dies a lot. I also enjoy anime, one example is Dog Days, and video games, Kingdom Hearts, Pokemon, Mario, Kirby. Before you ask, I do not hack, I did once get banned because I was playing with my brother and he was joking around and reported me, and a moderator must have thought that I was hacking, because I was banned. I was unbanned after things were set straight, and I enjoy playing on the server. If you see me, say hello! Unless you are on the other team in Nebula, in which case, you are going to die! Thank you for reading!\r\nP.S. I also love reading, Seven Wonders, Narnia, Inkheart, etc...","gender":"Male","interests":"Video Games, Anime, Books.","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"3,746","total_deaths":"3,521","total_pvp_deaths":"2,994","kd":"1.06","pvp_kd":"1.25","credits":"2,237","time":"3 days","joins":"176","created_at":"2013/11/10 00:11:34 +0000","created_at_human":"November 10, 2013 at 12:11 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"23","Wools":"2"},"friends":[]}
