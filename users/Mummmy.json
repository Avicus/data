{"username":"Mummmy","about":"Hey! I've been playing minecraft for years, I really enjoy playing avicus after 1.5 years I'm still here. I've met so many friends and the avicus community has grown so much! It's great playing the game and caching out those hackers, which is a regular occurrence for me and my brothers, it's great fun! XD I love playing with friends and family all the time. I've applied for mod before but if was banned last year so it got denied straight away. Good luck to Pastel though applying for mod!
