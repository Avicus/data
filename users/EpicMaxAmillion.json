{"username":"EpicMaxAmillion","about":"I love this server so much because you can't find the walls anywhere so conveniently placed. Also i never placed nexus before i came to this server and i enjoy it now along with nebula. I love to build things to help our team or maybe not our team (traps etc.) and I love the way that this server was built and the way that the wiring (Redstone and command blocks) of the world is set up making it an easy server to play/be on.\r\n","gender":"Male","interests":"music","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"376","total_deaths":"509","total_pvp_deaths":"439","kd":"0.74","pvp_kd":"0.86","credits":"0","time":"about 10 hours","joins":"24","created_at":"2013/12/08 07:09:42 +0000","created_at_human":"December  8, 2013 at  7:12 AM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"2"},"friends":[]}
