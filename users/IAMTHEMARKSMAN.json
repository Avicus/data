{"username":"IAMTHEMARKSMAN","about":"Who am I? \r\nNobody knows, nobody cares. My name is just a blatant reference to a time when I was playing Age of Empires 3 and the name- \"Marksman'' showed up. One year later, I received Minecraft for my Birthday. Without further ado, I attempted to make my username something like \"Marksman.\" USERNAME TAKEN! It became IAMTHEMARKSMAN. \r\n\r\nWhat am I?\r\nA specimen of Homo Sapiens with an deep dislike for team members who never defend and an appreciation for the fine arts.\r\n\r\nI have a bad record. I have been Warned 13 times, been Kicked 12 times and have been Temporarily Banned 4 times to date. All of those times for raging against my team-mates in one way or another because most of them do not now how to defend properly.\r\n\r\nDespite that, if I do happen to find a few loyal team-mates who appreciate building a sturdy and well-designed base, then I am in the Zone. It could be you...But it probably won't be. I don't think anybody has read my profile yet anyway.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","gender":"Male","interests":"Science, Music, Art and being Pensive.","staff":false,"color":"none","badges":[],"total_kills":"1,958","total_deaths":"3,954","total_pvp_deaths":"3,313","kd":"0.5","pvp_kd":"0.59","credits":"7,423","time":"4 days","joins":"294","created_at":"2014/03/19 15:48:21 +0000","created_at_human":"March 19, 2014 at  3:03 PM UTC","objective_data":{"Monuments":"12","Controls":"4"},"friends":[]}
