This so we can try and preserve the purity of our religion. Almost never do proper imaams even mention hadith that have even a chance of not being authentic. Of course there are some hadith out there which may not be correct, but that is why muslims try their best to only use the ones that they are sure about. Also, hadith is not the cause of terrorism. Hadith is where we get a lot of our information about islam. It makes it easier for us as a society to interpret and follow the Quran.","created_at":"2016/06/01 21:35:32 +0000","created_at_human":"June  1, 2016 at  9:06 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":306172,"unique_id":"306172-647","author":{"id":448366,"username":"emilizzle","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/d7677b7347f24ff0b5b5da9cddb47036?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Quran hasn't, Islam is clean without Hadith","body_tagged":"Quran hasn't, Islam is clean without Hadith","created_at":"2016/06/01 21:10:58 +0000","created_at_human":"June  1, 2016 at  9:06 PM UTC"}},{"id":306220,"unique_id":"306220-4942","author":{"id":48,"username":"JUBBINATOR","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b93149ea306e4369a276a2fc64d3c448?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Syriac Orthodoxy\u003cbr\u003eRaised in the faith, firm believer.","body_tagged":"Syriac Orthodoxy\u003cbr\u003eRaised in the faith, firm believer.","created_at":"2016/06/02 02:44:32 +0000","created_at_human":"June  2, 2016 at  2:06 AM UTC"},{"id":306225,"unique_id":"306225-2418","author":{"id":7003,"username":"FrostedCupcakez","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3fd4ab1ed8eabd9cb07dcce0f64724b?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"For anyone participating on this religion thread,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind that this is a sensitive topic like Sho stated.
