There's so much salt I feel like i'm fresh out of the mines lmfao. How about everyone just take a chill pill and stop lowkey (more highkey than lowkey) throwing shade at each other. I think that would work. It doesn't work to just argue and if you haven't noticed that by now, then you're clearly high on some good shit (if you are hmu.....jkjk). But honestly arguing like this (aka like petty ass 13 year old girls) gets you nowhere in the world and if you were to do this in real life (don't gimme that bs about this is the real world blah blah blah, you know what I mean and if you don't you can get your mind out of the gutter because we all know you know exactly what I mean) one would be taken as a joke or just completely ostracized. It'd do better to focus on working on the server, rather than fighting like complete assholes with no substance behind it. Also if you say \"then why doesn't your smartass give us some ideas?\" All if have to respond with is yea I can, and maybe I will, but honestly I'm not gonna get involved in a petty argument over a server with people I don't know personally and with those who won't influence my life. For one, everyone could stop with this bullshit, and by that I mean everyone...players on mods and vise versa. Secondly one great thing to maybe help is to change the approach being taken. You can't fix a small server by implementing things that would attract more players to a big server. They have completely different dynamics and a smaller server would fall apart. (Display one is to your left. It starts with A and ends with us...wait hey, that's funny cause if it were more about \"us\" than my egoistic self it'd work....ikr funny xD) For example if a small company entered the market and tried making decisions like Microsoft they'd fail horribly. They wouldn't have the resources nor support from the population to be able to experiment as easily. You need to be able to lock in a support base, and that means making it appealing to the population. Obviously that's much easier said than done. (I'm tired so I'm not gonna go further into detail atm) Next, instead of focussing on trying to do everything the regulars say (this is in no way shade at them lmfao I was one before too) take the approach of making a first time player's experience worthwhile and enjoyable. If you want more people, you need to have a solid hook to the server similar to an essay. Nobody likes to read an essay with a boring beginning. It has to be fun, invigorating, and most of all, easy to understand. There needs to be more of a community that welcomes newer players. Everyone already has their own groups and it turns into that high school situation where the already established groups of friends stay together and the new kid (who could be cool as shit) doesn't really know what to do so they just stay aloof (aka leaving the server after 5 minutes in this example) I bet there are players that have never come on avicus before coming on every day, but it doesn't matter because they leave and never return after a mere 3 minutes. But what if even 70 percent of these players tried it out and enjoyed it instead of the probably single digit amount recently. Even if not all of them would be regulars, many might still save it in their server lists and occasionally pop on, and most likely introduce it to friends. This is where you get the win, as these friends may possibly like it and stay on for 2 hours their first time. Then they do the same with other friends. Within no time, you have a large rotating community that keeps growing because it's being spread for free (by the best way to spread an idea: talking) To go on further, than maybe 20 percent of these players might become regulars and than you have consistent numbers now.

Even if not all of them would be regulars, many might still save it in their server lists and occasionally pop on, and most likely introduce it to friends. This is where you get the win, as these friends may possibly like it and stay on for 2 hours their first time. Then they do the same with other friends. Within no time, you have a large rotating community that keeps growing because it's being spread for free (by the best way to spread an idea: talking) To go on further, than maybe 20 percent of these players might become regulars and than you have consistent numbers now. So if you can nail this key piece, the newcomers I think it'd be a win. Yea, but going way back...if keemstar wouldn't even have to exaggerate to make a viral video with this shit, than clearly there's something being done wrong.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eAnyway that's my 2 cents...more like 4 essays, but that's just me ranting in text form. I'm really not mad and I legit enjoyed writing this, especially the sassy ass comments :P those are the best. But legit if anyone gets on my fucking case....mmm...no... this isn't geared towards anyone in specific just at everyone, and if you don't believe me, consider the fact that I probably don't know many of you guys and even if I do i've been out of the loop so I don't know what your reputation is or what you do.
