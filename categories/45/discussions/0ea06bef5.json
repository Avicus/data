As for prioritising minecraft over real life: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TO TELL ME THAT! Nah just kidding but on a serious note the only reason I said that is because I was awake since 12 am to what WAS about 4 or 5 pm; and obviously with school and having Firefighter stuff to do I will be tired. In the past I have been a little stupid to put videos games first but I have been getting way better at it. Nowadays I moderate when I feel like I can have fun playing on Avicus or if I get bored of PotPvP or railing people on Hypixel (4k on classic duels guys!) so I guess thats better than feeling forced to do a volunteer job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for getting involved with another area of the staff team, I could for sure handle having one or two more ranks, but to be fair I can't translate anything unless you want it in better english.

So, I choose to skim past that: I see that making such a thread makes you look insecure about your moderation, and furthermore in my perspective this is more or less a pull for attention to show the community that you actually want to do something to improve, yet you can't quite diagnose those issues yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering the point that there's a lot of moderators and almost no senior mods, there is the chance that this thread was made to possibly have you look as to fill a vacancy within the team.

How can I exceed the senior's standards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour responses seem like \"I can do that\" (in response to suggesting better things for the server) and \"I would gladly do that\" (taking leadership initiative), but those should be givens.
