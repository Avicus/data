For anyone who doesn't know what ping is it is your response time to a server (The lower your ping the better). Now I've noticed lately my ping has been at 400+ constantly. It is very hard to play in. Now some people may say I'm a liar but if you press tab in game you'll see my connection bars are at 3. Now onto the bit that really annoys me. Being called eZ. Now it's nobody on this forums but this sort of attitude just drives me to the limit. I'm trying to play in 400 ms whilst they probably have 30ms. But that's not all. At they end of the match they will call out. CreeperJoe it facking ez b¡Tch. Now, I know the best way to improve my ms is to move to Canada (never gonna happen) but I'm wondering if there's any latency fixes that people know work or just a way to cope with a high ms.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, Joe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso post below your ms so you can make me jealous :p.","body_tagged":"This post is mainly about ping.
