Personally I have kill-farmed alot on quintus, but how fix it? Its like team stack. You can stop it apart from getting a bad reputation towards the Avicus community. And if you are being kill-farmed do something! Take advantage of most of the opposing teams players being on your side. I honestly don't understand why people whine and cry about kill-farm when there is a clear path to ending it.","created_at":"2015/01/04 02:28:07 +0000","created_at_human":"January  4, 2015 at  2:01 AM UTC"}},{"id":133522,"unique_id":"133522-3121","author":{"id":412112,"username":"_Jupiter","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/666a363d92304924827909c05576d7c0?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Haha you pretty much wrote exactly what I would have said, so yeah ^","body_tagged":"Haha you pretty much wrote exactly what I would have said, so yeah ^","created_at":"2015/01/04 04:56:42 +0000","created_at_human":"January  4, 2015 at  4:01 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":133499,"unique_id":"133499-4061","author":{"id":3034,"username":"MangoSmoothie_","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/a832132d386f469688f76e39a0698c4c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Thank you for this thread! It was definitely needed. The problem is as well as the spawnkilling (according to the winning team, its called killfarming. ????), some staff do it and staff don't listen to people like me, and they think I'm just a sore loser. As well, the teams become overly one-sided, all the donors will go to the better team, so its like 30-20 in the end. I loved Quintus, in fact it was my favourite map. Now its one of my least. Some improvements should be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Diamond Swords \u0026amp; Bottle O' Enchanting instead of diamonds.\u003cbr\u003e- Make a direct route to iron, maybe a no-kill thing? Don't know hoe that would work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease improve Quintus! It has great potential, but right now it is terrible.","body_tagged":"Thank you for this thread!
