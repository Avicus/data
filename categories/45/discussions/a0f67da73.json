I guess this is the only thing that actually attracts attention from people on the server, the forums, so basically I'm just gonna state it here, go ahead staff, I know you are either gonna remove, lock, tell me to keep contacting avicus support, but if they are not doing anything, then I guess this is my only hope. I already have many infractions that don't make sense, but the staff still doesn't seem to reply to the many emails I sent them. I mean, I already found that at least 3 infractions, don't make sense in the last week or two, I emailed avicus, no reply, which was about 5 \u0026nbsp;days ago, still no reply, so if you guys won't do anything about it, what is the real point of even emailing them?","created_at":"2014/10/20 22:11:43 +0000","created_at_human":"October 20, 2014 at 10:10 PM UTC"}},{"id":104128,"unique_id":"104128-945","author":{"id":306135,"username":"aa1422","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/15039c12a2b145e2869e1220c9b3aee9?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"A'ight, thanks","body_tagged":"A'ight, thanks","created_at":"2014/10/21 22:36:58 +0000","created_at_human":"October 21, 2014 at 10:10 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":103788,"unique_id":"103788-4289","author":{"id":244350,"username":"Phobiaxx","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/312a0024b8d891a0b8b86e30c296b28d?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"There's a tiny shortage of Sr.Staff atm... more will be promoted soon though. ^_^ Just be patient, it'll be answered eventually.","body_tagged":"There's a tiny shortage of Sr.Staff atm... more will be promoted soon though. ^_^ Just be patient, it'll be answered eventually.","created_at":"2014/10/20 23:52:16 +0000","created_at_human":"October 20, 2014 at 11:10 PM UTC"}},{"id":104132,"unique_id":"104132-1754","author":{"id":150549,"username":"AtditC","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fb57ed989f4140c78e61dee46d34d427?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"bye :C","body_tagged":"bye :C","created_at":"2014/10/21 22:39:39 +0000","created_at_human":"October 21, 2014 at 10:10 PM UTC"},{"id":104149,"unique_id":"104149-3776","author":{"id":330003,"username":"Stimulating","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/779b7f782ecf4da790babb43fb608796?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Bye I guess, even though I never really met you :P.
