While killing was not part of their agenda, they were very violent and radical. They were mere steps from becoming killers, similar to Shay's rebellion.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, how can you join pressure groups for change when you aren't even taken seriously? When you feel that things aren't going to change within your lifetime, and that the system is actively pushing you down no matter what. Similar thoughts led to a lot of the violence caused by black separatists during the civil rights movement as well as the domestic terrorism done by groups such as the KKK during reconstruction.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey don't refuse to seek help, but rather the only ones who would \"Help\" are these radical groups. Many groups are actively being ostracised by society, they are not isolating themselves. The Tamil Tigers, despite doing atrocities of the worst kind in their terror campaign, were being put down by the majority Sinhalese government. Hell, hate towards muslims is still very much a problem, though perhaps not one seen daily by you and I, but one very present nonetheless.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not saying all terrorists are lost. I am not denying the existence of evil men and evil organisations. But not everyone in these organisations is as evil as you make them out to be. If their only light came from a tiny LED bulb and from a bonfire, many are going to head straight toward the bonfire, even if it burns them. They are being led astray and harming themselves and many other people in their pursuit of a \"righteous cause\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's happened so many times in history to good people, and this time is no exception. Not everything can be so black and white, split into good and evil, unfortunately. Humans are flawed, and everything falls within a spectrum.","created_at":"2016/07/10 03:57:14 +0000","created_at_human":"July 10, 2016 at  3:07 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":316816,"unique_id":"316816-3468","author":{"id":72173,"username":"Myworld6","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6248019ce74a42a4bf4b9cf1c189a72d?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Brainwashed or not, only a coward attacks children, simply because that child is of a different faith or is homosexual.
