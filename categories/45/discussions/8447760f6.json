So recently I found out that my cousin's bf builds PCs, and he told me if I knew if the processor can fit in the socket, you know, if they are the same generation socket and processor. He also told me the video card is amazing, so no worries on that. Can anyone tell me if it fits in the socket? thanks","created_at":"2015/06/02 02:05:20 +0000","created_at_human":"June  2, 2015 at  2:06 AM UTC"}},{"id":208120,"unique_id":"208120-3234","author":{"id":5141,"username":"Sevoo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/0f2408c6b4554076a115d9ea6c81a335?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Ok now, sorry for the bump.
