What if the forums had a chat bar! So basically it could work in two different ways; 1. It could be a spam bar, where any player can right whatever they want, and they don't have to got through the hauling process of of posting things on the forums and waiting a long time for people to reply. Instead, this spam bar could just be a place to post the most random of stuff players could want. The second way that this could work is that each individual player could have a little chat bubble/bar sort of thing on the side of the chat page. The chat page is where the chat will be located. The chat bubble, will display the players name, and if they are online or not. Here's the one drag of this concept. We would have to add an \"add friends\" button to the forums, so that only people that are your friends could message you. I made this post because I feel that this would be a fun, new way to communicate with each other! I hope you guys understand my idea! If not its ok!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and Luck,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShamrock","body_tagged":"Hey guys, Sham here,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just thought of an awesome idea regarding a social aspect of the forums.
