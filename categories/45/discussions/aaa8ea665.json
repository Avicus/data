It's called network computing, and it involves distributing work to volunteer machines which process tiny fragments of a large chunk of data and report back to a job server. By installing the BOINC software on your computer and signing up for projects, you can make a measurable contribution to the cause of science and mathematics.

You can change settings in the program to not run when your computer is on battery or not to run while you're using the computer. Everything is totally customizable, including how much time you want your computer to donate to each project. You don't need a beefy computer (although you'll do more work if you do have one). If you have a compatible GPU (you can search for a list, it must have updated drivers), the system will use that for compatible projects as well and increase your computing speed many times over. Obviously, running intense tasks will require more power to the computer, but if you can afford it and would like to contribute to science, it's well worth it.
