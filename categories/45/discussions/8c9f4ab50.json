I am YouCantCMe better known as Zac. I have created this post to express my concern over the two issues presented in the title of this thread. Constructive comedy is comedy that relates to a sensitive topic usually taking the less agreed upon or more radical side as to present that topic in a new light that not only allows recipients of these jokes to take these matters with more grace but also to shine a new light upon these issues. Constructive comedy is often confused with immaturity when in fact it is only by addressing and moving past these issues can we truly put them to rest. Censorship destroys the opportunity for constructive comedy in attempts to ignore these issues until we forget about them, a rather impractical notion. Censorship can also be used correctley to protect people who would feel emotional trauma from experiencing these more offensive types of comedy. However the way to go about this would be by designating a select area where these constructive comedy pieces can be shared without risk of running into more sensitive recipients rather than removing the right to discuss these topics as a whole. Irl these people go to designated shows, clubs or websites to distribute their content to consumers who readily accept it. This same idea should be used in avicus TS as well as the forums. There should be designated sections of TS where users can go to discuss these issues through comedy unhindered. The forums should also ask you permission to show more explicit content, if denied permission certain topics will not be viewable to that specific user but will remain available for others. Thanks for your time.","body_tagged":"Greetings fellow avicus player. I am YouCantCMe better known as Zac.
