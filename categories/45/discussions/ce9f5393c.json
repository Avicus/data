I've done a lot of things you guys asked like lowering the game volume, making the gameplay better etc. Tell me what you guys think of this - is it bad or is it good? Again it would mean a lot to me if you could just put your opinion; you don't have to watch the whole thing just skip through the video and tell me what you think of the gameplay and commentary :).
