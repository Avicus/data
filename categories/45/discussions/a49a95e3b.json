I keep changing my sensitivity and I feel that different sensitivity's feel right at different times. I don't even know if this is possible but I figured the mouse must be auto changing it's DPI. Like I said before I don't know if this is the case but can someone help me change it back/ find the real problem xd.","body_tagged":"I've had my Logitech M185 (Some cheap non gaming mouse lol) for roughly a year and 3 months, it was fine until yesterday.

Crusty it depends on if your mouse has a driver/macros or a DPI changers button. If it has a driver/macros then load it up and check your settings. If it has a button then check its not jammed or broken. If it is then you may need to get a new mouse, if it isn't then i don't think i can help you.","body_tagged":"Vsplesk that comment does not help and its off topic its just you wanting to show off, zedther and brian's comments are similar only asking for sympathy.
