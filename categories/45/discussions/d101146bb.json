So recently there has been this huge controversial topic going around all over the world!! Now if you do not follow football you probably won't understand this, and I do not mean \"american\" football, I mean real football. Ok so I will be discussing two world class players, pretty boy Cristiano Ronaldo and the legend Ben Watson! The word is going around that Ben Watson has been outshining Ronaldo :O :\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst we will talk about Ben Watson! Now let me inform you that this man has only played for the top line clubs!\u003cbr\u003e- Wigan Athletic\u003cbr\u003e- West Brom \u003cbr\u003e- QPR\u003cbr\u003e- Watford (the best club ever)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough Ben Watson is considered a midfielder, he is a better forward/midfield shit idk than Ronaldo. He has excellent stats and a work ethic that makes you rethink your life. He has played 310 matches, starting in 263 of them, and has scored 37 scores overall. He also has over 20,000 minutes played, and has 28 assists (unselfish like messi). Outstandingly he only has 38 yellow cards, and 3 reds. I am surprised this man has not won the Ballon d'Or. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe teams Ronaldo has played for are quite trashy imo, but hey I am only 5 years old. No I do not mean the Brazilian legend Ronaldo, I mean pretty boy CR7 Ronaldo :D!\u003cbr\u003e- Sporting (wtf even is that team)\u003cbr\u003e- Manchester United (can't get in the top 5 haha)\u003cbr\u003e- Real Madrid (RIP TREBLE HAHA)\u003cbr\u003e- Portugal national team too ig...It is a shame my boi\u0026nbsp; snakey Payet showed him wassup\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I am warning you Ronaldo's stats are quite depressing, but if we all work together we can make it through this man's \"era\"...I think he will retire soon tbh. Ok anyways he has played 347 matches with 364 goals and 100 assists. He also has played over 20,000 minutes and has 44 yellow cards and 4 red cards. Unlike my man Ben Watson, Ronaldo is known for being selfish and arrogant. Rumor has it that he puts more time into his eyebrows than the well being of his teammates haha ex de. So the whole issue with this topic is Watson is clearly a player with way more class and skill, but he is still yet to win the flippin Ballon d'Or! While Ronaldo is over here sitting with like 4 I think. It is totally unfair omg :( Something needs to change to stop this undeserving man from winning the Ballon d'Or. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatson \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://futhead.cursecdn.com/static/img/17/players/160292.png\" title=\"Image: http://futhead.cursecdn.com/static/img/17/players/160292.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRonaldo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://futhead.cursecdn.com/static/img/17/players/20801.png\" title=\"Image: http://futhead.cursecdn.com/static/img/17/players/20801.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- WHO IS BETTER RONALDO OR WATSON??? \u003cbr\u003eps sorry if my english is poor, it isn't my first language\u003cbr\u003eAlso pls no lock I want to see what people think\u003cbr\u003eAlso please do not confuse me with {tag=113cad449bac492eaf46b0cc54b38c4c} we are two different people","body_tagged":"Hey guys it is your boy Alan the man the myth and the LEGEND.
