He momentarily reappeared in battle with the Hulk's son Skaar, still identifying himself as the \"Worldbreaker\". He seems to have resurfaced after Bruce regained his Hulk powers, his anger tempered from its \"Worldbreaker\" levels by another confrontation with Skaar, and was proven even strong enough to take down the Red Hulk without much of a fight despite Red Hulk continuously absorbing Hulk's radiation to empower himself. The Hulk lived up to his \"Worldbreaker\" title by destroying a world (from the huge amounts of gamma energy he was releasing) in the Dark Dimension.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, Hulk did marry someone and can break a world.","created_at":"2014/06/19 02:44:11 +0000","created_at_human":"June 19, 2014 at  2:06 AM UTC"},{"id":21093,"unique_id":"21093-486","author":{"id":3729,"username":"NuclearDucky","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/173909d33d81486eeaf829372c4371ce?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Cool story, lulle, tell it again.","body_tagged":"Cool story, lulle, tell it again.","created_at":"2014/06/19 02:47:22 +0000","created_at_human":"June 19, 2014 at  2:06 AM UTC"},{"id":21100,"unique_id":"21100-4498","author":{"id":62,"username":"BOSS_Turtle98","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9bd206b142a24b478d96bb7effaa01f3?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Gg Yoav, gg.","body_tagged":"Gg Yoav, gg.","created_at":"2014/06/19 02:55:12 +0000","created_at_human":"June 19, 2014 at  2:06 AM UTC"},{"id":21122,"unique_id":"21122-3038","author":{"id":269957,"username":"lulle265","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5664dbdb98b648b6bb39e4f4dc79c487?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I'll tell it from the very beginning.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hulk was at a rage, and there was a group of 7 superheros called the Illuminati, made of Mr. Fantastic, Iron Man, Professor X, Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, Namor and Black Panther, formed to fight against large threats of Extra-Terrestrial threats, since all of them specialized in something important.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStuff happened, and the group had to think about the raging Hulk (Da prof. aint here right now).
