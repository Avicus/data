Most of the people will also accept people that can speak English + they sometimes even offer courses to improve the German skills of their employees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the education is Turkey isn't that good as you say, then I would move to Germany :)\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any more questions, contact me on Skype: \u003cb\u003eflo.schmenni\u003c/b\u003e or just post in this thread :D","created_at":"2016/01/28 15:51:15 +0000","created_at_human":"January 28, 2016 at  3:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":274802,"unique_id":"274802-3732","author":{"id":342908,"username":"resepignev","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75bbb65651fdf39379295c23e9a242d7?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I would say so.
