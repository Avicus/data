Take note that these is the only keyboards on these list with no macro keys (the keyboards still are fully programmable). If you want the exact same thing as the K70 RGB or non RGB, go for the Corsair K95 RGB or non RGB. The K95 has 18 extra macro keys, if you really need them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe K70 RGB goes at around 160$ CAD, and the non RGB around 130$.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Strafe RGB is around 140$, then non RGB around 120$.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe K95 RGB goes at about 170-180$, and the non RGB around 150$.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake note, I just gave you all the expensive options. Tell me if these are too much money, I'll be happy to do some research. You too, look at reviews of each keyboard If you have time.","created_at":"2015/11/06 13:44:03 +0000","created_at_human":"November  6, 2015 at  1:11 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":246619,"unique_id":"246619-4661","author":{"id":229689,"username":"JustBudah","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/71a5754115dd4df99eb6b591df9859a1?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I would say that I am a gamer.","body_tagged":"I would say that I am a gamer.","created_at":"2015/11/06 05:17:31 +0000","created_at_human":"November  6, 2015 at  5:11 AM UTC"}}]}
