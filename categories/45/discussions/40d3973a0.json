I joined OCN (back then Project Ares) almost 4 years ago when it was only one server and they had just released PGM 2.0. I played there a lot until I made some major mistakes and unfortunately was removed from all contact with the server. This is an extremely sad day for me since I still really think of OCN as my original Minecraft home. Sure, the community has changed since I left, but it still has the roots of one of the best communities and servers I have been a part of. I used to religiously watch Apple's streams and would even watch and re-watch old archives. I have tears on my keyboard at this points so I'll wrap up this part of the post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI urge you all to not trash OCN in any way, as it will just make us look back. I urge you all to embrace new players with open arms and to make them feel welcome. I personally don't think it would be right for us to use OCN maps, since they were built for that network and the community that originally played there. The core maps, such as the race for victory series and other extremely nostalgic maps, were built by the first real players of OCN, and they would have never thought that this day would come just a mere 3 1/2 years later. Out of respect for their creativity and ideas, it just wouldn't seem right to just take them without their explicit permission. I would love to play OCn maps, but only on OCN.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you've read this far, I thank you for reading my entire post and hope this has touched you in some way.\u003cbr\u003eThank you OCN for all you have done and the groundbreaking innovations that are seen in Avicus today.

I joined OCN (back then Project Ares) almost 4 years ago when it was only one server and they had just released PGM 2.0. I played there a lot until I made some major mistakes and unfortunately was removed from all contact with the server. This is an extremely sad day for me since I still really think of OCN as my original Minecraft home. Sure, the community has changed since I left, but it still has the roots of one of the best communities and servers I have been a part of. I used to religiously watch Apple's streams and would even watch and re-watch old archives. I have tears on my keyboard at this points so I'll wrap up this part of the post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI urge you all to not trash OCN in any way, as it will just make us look back. I urge you all to embrace new players with open arms and to make them feel welcome. I personally don't think it would be right for us to use OCN maps, since they were built for that network and the community that originally played there. The core maps, such as the race for victory series and other extremely nostalgic maps, were built by the first real players of OCN, and they would have never thought that this day would come just a mere 3 1/2 years later.

I could give my side of the story. As I have been playing there for about 1 .5 years I have noticed a player drop. Everyday there would be less players on the server, but it was still about 350-500 players, so all was good. But then once it fully updated to 1.8 it lossed a good 50-100 players going down to a not so good 250-400, still a decent amount, but not enough. I still played the server and loved it. Eventually reaching 100 wools, and then just a few months later 200. Then I started to become very inactive, I was already inactive, and then the monster came. 1.9 *dramatic music* Once 1.9 came out I usually went on OCN a good 1 a month. I got very inactive. So inactive I made a forums post about me semi quitting. But then something brought me back. I think it was myself missing OCN and the great community. When 1.9 came I wasn't the only player to \"quit\". The player count right now is \"209\" But when it first switched to 1.9, I saw times where there were just 50 players on... Thats when I knew that OCN might shutdown sometime soon. I didn't think this soon of course. But I hope this could clear some stuff up about OCN for you Avicus players. Atleast your player count will go up. Maybe people will actually play CTW on here after it closes :/","body_tagged":"As an OCN player. I could give my side of the story.
