And what benefit would Microsoft even have from \r\nobtaining Mojang? They now have a rag-tag team of developers, and a game\r\n that has already been out for years? Sure Minecraft still has lots of \r\nlife left to go, but not worth 2 billion dollars kind of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I do not believe that Notch would be driven by monetary reasons. He's been quoted saying that \"he has more money now than he could ever spend.\" In fact, I have a friend that \u003ci\u003ewatched\u003c/i\u003e him say that in an interview with Craig Ferguson.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIt'll be worth keeping an eye on, but until Mojang makes statements, I wouldn't believe any of it actually happening.","created_at":"2014/09/10 20:53:24 +0000","created_at_human":"September 10, 2014 at  8:09 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":81276,"unique_id":"81276-1646","author":{"id":4479,"username":"Riskayyy","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b7153466dc6a08f9f2ee06648e9c440c?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"To be honest, I think Microsoft wants to save Minecraft c:","body_tagged":"To be honest, I think Microsoft wants to save Minecraft c:","created_at":"2014/09/10 05:59:45 +0000","created_at_human":"September 10, 2014 at  5:09 AM UTC"}},{"id":81495,"unique_id":"81495-2712","author":{"id":19965,"username":"SGMC","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/ab366367d3314fecb162384ada6921ad?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Okay, update.
