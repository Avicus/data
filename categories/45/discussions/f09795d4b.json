I walked to school and said hi to my friends in the hallway. We had an assembly and once that was finished our teacher told us that we are going to have recess with our reading buddies (Reading buddies are second graders who will read with us once in a while. I was playing tag and running a lot. I was soon out of breath so I sat down on the ground. Suddenly our teacher said that our recess was over so I walked to our line. I started to see everything very blurry. I told my best friend (who's IGN Is penguin102002) that I started to see things blurry and then suddenly I saw nothing. I thought I turned blind or something but our teacher saw that I looked like I was going to faint. Then she told me to sit down and then I did. Two minutes I saw everything very blurry again and then a minute later I saw everything usual. The nurse brang me a wheelchair and I sat on it. I went to the nurse's office. She checked my pulse and temperature and she knew what happened. I almost fainted! So she gave me some cheese crackers and some water so I can feel better. Suddenly penguin102002 came with all my other friends and they brought me a poster. That poster had everyone sign a get well soon. I was happy that everyone did this for me. They were so kind. Then penguin came back in 10 minutes later with my other friend ( the other friend's IGN is z011104) and they got all the stuff out of my desk since everyone was going to clean out there desks. They were the best friend I could ever have. :'). Later my mother came and she took me home. Now I am taking some rest. I will come to playing Avicus tomorrow when I feel ok. Thanks for listening to my story!","body_tagged":"Hello everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be wondering why the clockracer is not at school right now.
