Nothing better to do, and life comes to fast. I fell like things in the game just aren't feeling as fun, and they've lost their appeal. I think I'm leaving, hopefully not permanently, because there are a lot of people I don't want to leave or let down. I know it seems like it came out of no where, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I've noticed how negatively this game has been affecting my life, I've been lashing out at family, and just having a worse and worse time every time I play. Some people have been involved in\u0026nbsp;the issue, but I don't want any names thrown out there. So, for now this is a goodbye, I'm taking a break, maybe forever, but I highly doubt it. Goodbye for\u0026nbsp;a while to everyone, and I mean everyone here, that I've played with, and that I've spoken with. I'm staying in touch with many, and I'll be having games with close friends often, but just not as much.
