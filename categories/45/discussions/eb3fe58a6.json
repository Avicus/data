Only the people who have been with Avicus from the start will remember me, so you're probably wondering who I am. I was a senior mod on this server since it was MC Zone and left close to the start to focus on college and getting a job and just because I was really down about my life and how I'd done nothing to be truly proud of and how I wanted to turn things around. Well... I did. To a certain extent. I got high grades in college, was unemployed for 6 months which was horrible but eventually turned things round, got a job, made good money, got an amazing car (a Mazda 3 hatchback) and things started to look well for me over the new year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I'm not here to talk about my success, because I completely ruined everything last night.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was driving home at like 1am (I work til late) and the roads seemed fine, wet, but fine. Then just the next thing I knew I was sliding off the road at about 50mph and all I had time for was to think about how this could be the end of my life. I crashed into a concrete wall stopping cars from going into an embankment, knocked the wall clean out, flipped over and the next thing I knew the car was on its side (my side) in the middle of the road (but I thought I was in a ditch at the time and that no one would find me). I rang the police (god knows how I got the signal cause I was in the middle of nowhere) and climbed up and out the car through the passenger side and it was only then I realised there was barely a scratch on me. The car, however, was completely gone. The engine had been completely ripped out and debris was scattered all over the road. The police came, breathalysed me (zero, I'm not bloody stupid) and took my details and I was checked over by an ambulance and warmed up then my dad came to pick me up. The car's been written off and taken to a scrapyard. I only had that car 3 months, it was second hand but had only done 40,000 miles (I had only done 3000) and it was my pride and joy. I have no idea how much its going to cost in insurance but whether I get a new cheap car or not the Mazda is on a 5-year finance deal so for the next 5 years I'm going to be paying off a car which isn't mine anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I'm not here for sympathy either, cause it was me that fucked up, and no one else. I'm here to just get one message across.

The fact that I could get out my car without a scratch is an even bigger one. Someone up there must like me, cause if anything had happened to me that would have been it. I would have left this life with no story, nothing to be proud of, only a handful of people would know or indeed care, and everything that I've worked towards in life would have been for nothing. But I was given a second chance, I could go home and hug my family which I never do, stroke my cats again, and finally tell my best friend who I've been mad at for some stupid reason and ignored for weeks how much she actually meant to me.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut not everyone gets that chance, and I found out that it doesn't matter how okay everything seems, or how good you are at anything. Something can go wrong at any given time, when you least expect it. So, just for me, if you have anything you want to say to anyone, if you're sorry for something but still too mad at that person to say it, or if you miss them, love them, want them to know anything, just fucking say it.

Sometimes learning the hard way is the best way, though I'm kind of hesitant to say so, given the circumstance. If you need a friend, someone to talk to, I got your back. I was in a car crash over a month ago, so I can kind of relate. The car in front of us stopped, we managed to break in time, but the car behind us smashed into us at around 80km/h and pushed 5-6ft into the car in front of us. Our car had $15k worth of damage to it, barely off being totaled. After being hit from behind, another car hit us, meaning both my Dad and I's heads had snapped 3 times, giving both of us whiplash. I had put my hands out in front of me to stop me slamming into the dashboard, the 4 fingers on my left hand all got pretty badly hyper-extended and took a month of therapy to repair the tissue and tendon damage to my hand, but I realized how fortunate I was to even be living. My PC was also in the back, unscathed. Both my dad and I were ok and only one person went to the hospital with minor injuries (at least from my knowledge). Though this isn't about me, or a pity party for me, the point is we were all so fortunate that nothing worse happened. A lot of us are very fortunate. Be thankful for every day you're given, you are so lucky to be on this planet alone.","body_tagged":"Adding on to this, always have the strength to keep going, always try to find the silver lining in things, don't let grudges drag you down and live the best you can while you still can.
