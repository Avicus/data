I tried using DaBadger for minecraft but it was taken, so I decided to go with DaBadgerMC. Since my older brother was the one typing the username, he botched it and forgot the g making it DaBaderMC. At the time, name changes weren't a thing, so I was stuck with it for awhile, but then got use to it.

My next name was...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eTheXiphias (third)\u003c/b\u003e - I got tired of Pyrocumulus so I chose this. It's the scientific name for swordfish. I didn't even really know how to pronounce it, lol. Is it Zif-e-us? X-if-eas? I dunno. I regretted doing that right after I changed it lol.

I actually really liked it and still do, but it's taken now, so yeah, that's sad. A few people still refer to me as this which is pretty cool.

I changed it, and kept it for quite some time. A lot of people still refer to me as Eako, but a lot of them can't seem to pronounce it correctly, haha.

I took a look at an older YouTuber called Spoonerism and noticed his channel name was TheCampingTree. I thought that name was pretty dank, so I chose something with the same format. I liked this name a lot, and still do, but I wanted another change because I guess I have a fetish or something. I changed to...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003ePresidentBadger (tenth)\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e - One of my favorite names yet. I'm keeping it, I simply went back to this name for a little throwback. I wanted to make a YouTuhe channel someday so I thought \"If I name myself something like GeneralBadger or KingBadger, I could call my fan base the Animal Kingdom or the Badger Clan!\" Neither of those were available, so I switched to PresidentBadger. I was debating whether or not I should pick PresidentAnimal or PresidentBadger, and this name came out on top. Will I ever change my name again?

It was a shared account which my older brothers, younger sister, and I played out. My two brothers quit minecraft a long time ago, but my sister and I continued. Now she's left and rarely ever comes back on, so it's kinda a deserted account, haha. Anyways, my oldest brother came up with it out of nowhere. This account was made many years ago, and I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to keep the name forever. It was just a placeholder, but it looks like it stayed. It's a dead account, but I'll keep it forever, even if nobody plays on it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cb\u003eDaBaderMC (first and current for a throwback)\u003c/b\u003e - When I first got my Xbox 360, I literally thought up \"Da Badger\" in 2 minutes.

I wanted to make a YouTuhe channel someday so I thought \"If I name myself something like GeneralBadger or KingBadger, I could call my fan base the Animal Kingdom or the Badger Clan!\" Neither of those were available, so I switched to PresidentBadger.
