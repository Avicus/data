It is similar to CTW in that you are trying to acquire certain wools before the other team. Two teams of four players each race to complete various dungeons, ranging from PvE challenges to PvP challenges as well as many other types, i.e. Parkour, shared lane (opportunity for sword PvP), etc, before the other team can complete theirs. After these dungeons are completed, all of the objectives must be placed on the victory monument, located elsewhere on the map. The lanes are separated by a large void gap which you cannot bridge over (a plugin on the server will automatically destroy blocks placed in the void. In addition, players that leave and then re-enter their lane will be killed, with all of their items immediately despawning), effectively making PvP possible only with cannons and bows. After RMCT 5, the RMCT administrators decided to allow community run tournaments to be endorsed and contribute to the seeding for the next major tournament, RMCT 6 (happening \"Soon\"). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you’d like to see a game of Race for Wool, (\u003ca title=\"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_7oaKHsvM\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_7oaKHsvM\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_7oaKHsvM\u003c/a\u003e) is a quality match.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFormat\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tournament will be played in Minecraft 1.7.10.\u0026nbsp; The format consists of two stages, a round robin group stage and a single elimination bracket stage.
