So I was on PMC aka Planet Minecraft\u0026nbsp;today and saw one of the skinners that I'm subbed to posted something about her school. When I read about what happend to her and what happend to other students at that school it really shocked me and made me feel well really sad for her and the other people at that school that could have been\u0026nbsp;sexual harassed or have\u0026nbsp;a mental illness that was, or still is being\u0026nbsp;ignored. Anyways I signed a petition about opening her high school's eyes about the problem going on there and It would be great if you guys could sign it as well. Lily (the girl doing this whole thing) can explain it better.\u0026nbsp;There is already 140 supporters\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;It would help a lot if you supported her too. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
