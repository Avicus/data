Actually its been here for quite some time. In case people haven't heard, there is a virtual reality headset called the Oculus Rift. The price range i think is like $300-$400. \u0026nbsp;I saw some gameplays and its not bad considering the games. I mean, they look real and graphics are not bad considering it to be new but it is not as great. I have seen a guy playing Battlefield 3 or 4? idk and it looked sweet.

Of course, i am not going to buy an Oculus Rift because the games and quality still need to be developed. Virtual Reality has potential in the nearer future.
