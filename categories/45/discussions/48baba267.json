I have met many many people through Avicus, throughout my very long time being here, after my sister told me to come on the server all that time ago. I was basically a meme for wanting mod back then, but in the end, I got it, starting off at Media, then swapped to ref, then finally to mod, and then to top it off social media, and then where I am now. I knew this day would come where the server would die, but I was told that as long as the mods moderate and the developers develop, then server will stay for a long time, so closing fairly soon took me by surprise, despite it did have very low to little players on so we all was expecting it.
