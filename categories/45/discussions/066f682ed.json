Why is this a problem? I have lots of problems with the logic of the movie, serious problems...\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, with that aside, this discussion is for people who are bored or feel like pouring their hearts out. (I'm not even sure if you're allowed to share your life story on here... :/ #rebel) I will go first and cover at least the main points of my life... Feel free to sit back on your comfy lazy chair with a bag of popcorn and a sippy sip thing coz it's gonna be a long\u0026nbsp;boring trip down memory lane, enjoy :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOk, so I'll start at the very beginning. I was born on the 10th of July, 2000. That makes me 14 right now. I was born in Auckland, New Zealand at the hour of the early mornings people would hate to be woken up at -\u0026nbsp;I call this hour, Devil's Hour. I was brought up on a large farm with lots of sheep, dogs, goats, 27 CATS, chickens, a cow and a little sister. My childhood flourished amongst animals which gave me the personality to love (almost) every animal. I moved to Brisbane, Australia in 2004.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-- We had visited Australia once when I was about 3; My family visited a beach and kind of attended to my sister while my curiosity led me to the sheer drop of a cliff suspended about the sea, I fell in. The impact surprisingly did little damage to my small baby body (my baby fat probably acted like diamond armour towards the fall damage), the tide swept me onto the shore where my parents found me and proposed that I had just been playing in the sea instead of falling in it. --\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe moved houses a lot so I lost most of my friends. My family finally found the perfect house, our current house. It's behind the motorway, so it is noisy, but the big foresty thing kind of shields 50% of the noise. I went to blah blah primary school and met my best friend (mc name, JayJayFEVER11). I met a few more friends along the way, but I mostly stuck to myself. Here is when it gets a bit dark and may trigger so read on your own risk...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWhen I was 8-years-old I was diagnosed with a psychological disorder known as Schizophrenia. At 12 years of age I developed depression and became suicidal. I lost contact with most of my friends and I felt really alone. I started to cut and even attempted suicide, I was only in grade 7. In grade 8, my first year of high school, I tried to make more friends. I was 'invited' into this small group of friends that consisted of really random and outgoing people, I didn't feel like I fitted in but I stayed anyway hoping it would change me for the better. After a few months of high school, I started to fit in and formed close bonds with each of my friends. I did well on my report cards and started writing stories and drawing as a dedicated hobby. Mid that year, my family was involved in a serious chemical explosion that happened in our house. My mum tried to unblock a toilet with Hydrochloric Acid and it did some weird sciency stuff and just exploded. The gas filled the house and temporarily poisoned our lungs. That night was one of the most scariest night of our life as the paramedics say we were only 7 minutes away from death. That epidemic dragged me back into depression and my cutting got worse. I only stopped cutting a few months into 2014, and I hope I stop for good. After multiple visits to psychiatrists, my Schizophrenia became less severe. I stopped overdosing on pills and started doing more exercise. I have been on this server for about 2 weeks now and I have made unbelievable bonds with many players. This server and it's people have made me happier than I've ever been in my life and I couldn't ask for\u0026nbsp;a better birthday gift than this happiness they bring to me. I am talking about jakesandobal, yoavkipper, jozzmcozz, MihanR, DarkArcher and Ingigo in particular. I would like to give my deepest thank you to all of you for giving me the most precious gift a person could give. I will never forget you and I hope you never forget me. I love you all c:\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have devoted my life to helping others and being that person who you can feel comfortable telling anything to. That person who will always listen. That person who will always be there. Because that was\u0026nbsp;the person I needed when I was drowning in my shadows. And as a player, I want to make Avicus a unique server. \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cspan\u003ehey....\u003cbr\u003eSo hi everyone, I want to get more involved in the community and post this discussion, the majority of the reason being that it's family movie night and I want to watch 21 Jump Street while my mum and little sister want to watch Titanic.
