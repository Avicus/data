to attempt a water landing, if it ran out of fuel per se.\u003cbr\u003eit would have to attempt a water landing\u003cbr\u003ethe sharp U-Turn they took would have caused them to severely drop in altitude\u003cbr\u003eand increase it speed.\u003cbr\u003eWith the speed it was going, and the low altitude, there was only the option of tthe\u003cbr\u003ewater landing.\u003cbr\u003eWhen attempting water landings, planes like the DC9 have engines situated above the wings, the type of plane (Triple 7) has engines situated below the wings.\u003cbr\u003eUpon hitting the water with frightening speed, the engines would have tried to scoop the water in a sense, while trying to go through it, this would ultimately tear the plane apart.\u003cbr\u003eIt has happened before though, but many people survived.\u003cbr\u003eAn Ethiopian plane was hijacked, and it ran \u0026nbsp;out of fuel, it was forced to make\u003cbr\u003ea water landing,\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eplus\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eit was a triple 7 aircraft, it had engines on the below of the plane.\u003cbr\u003eIt broke into three pieces in the water, and miraculously didn't cartwheel.\u003cbr\u003eBut, with no contact from it in almost 2 months, I highly doubt there were survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always kind of thought this though..\u003cbr\u003eonce, two giant disks followed a plane, the pilots being scared s**tless didn't know what to do, so they just went with the flow, and they successfully landed, what if this happened, but they were abducted or something?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eexcuse my superstition XD","created_at":"2014/06/19 11:02:57 +0000","created_at_human":"June 19, 2014 at 11:06 AM
