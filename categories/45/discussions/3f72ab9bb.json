People have found ways to sort of control knockback. Basically, in Minecraft there is a thing called sprint knockback. Sprint knockback is where you deal more knockback than just standing by sprinting toward your opponent. There is a glitch however. When the sprint key was released in 1.7 you are now able to hold it and you can keep sprinting even after you hit your enemy, but only the first hit is sprint knockbacked, the hits after your first hit will deal the same knockback as if you were just standing. People have found this glitch and found out that after you hit someone and reset your sprint you can enhance your knockback. There are a couple ways to increase knockback: W repressing, hybrid blocking, and hybrid sneaking, sprint key spam, and hybrid \"s\"ing. To do a W repress you have to quickly release and repress w after you hit your enemy. To do a hybrid block/sneak/s you quickly right click/shift/press s after you hit your enemy. To sprint key spam you, well, spam control (or you can time it by pressing it quickly once after each hit). I prefer using the w repress because you can make up a bunch of cool strafes with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there seems to be another glitch. If you change your motion right when you are hit the knockback you receive will be decreased to almost no knockback given. I also found a couple ways to do this: You can press w and d to circle strafe and then press a right when you are hit (You can also press w and a and press d when you are hit). You can do a special zig-zag strafe where you start by pressing w and d and then when you are hit you let go of d and press a instead, then all you have to do is to repeat the pattern. You can switch from pressing w to pressing s when you are hit.

People have found ways to sort of control knockback. Basically, in Minecraft there is a thing called sprint knockback. Sprint knockback is where you deal more knockback than just standing by sprinting toward your opponent. There is a glitch however. When the sprint key was released in 1.7 you are now able to hold it and you can keep sprinting even after you hit your enemy, but only the first hit is sprint knockbacked, the hits after your first hit will deal the same knockback as if you were just standing. People have found this glitch and found out that after you hit someone and reset your sprint you can enhance your knockback. There are a couple ways to increase knockback: W repressing, hybrid blocking, and hybrid sneaking, sprint key spam, and hybrid \"s\"ing. To do a W repress you have to quickly release and repress w after you hit your enemy. To do a hybrid block/sneak/s you quickly right click/shift/press s after you hit your enemy. To sprint key spam you, well, spam control (or you can time it by pressing it quickly once after each hit). I prefer using the w repress because you can make up a bunch of cool strafes with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there seems to be another glitch.
