In case you don't know me my name is Riley and I have played on the Avicus network for almost two years now. I have enjoyed seeing the players come and go and making many friends along the way. However, I only joined the forums last December and soon after that I became a mod in January's Staff Batch which many have come to know as the \"rookie batch.\" I was absolutely loving my time as a mod and everyone said I was really nice and all that, and then I got demoted. However I don't want to talk about that, cause there isn't really a point to anyways. Now let's talk about the main point of this article.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-redactor=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-redactor=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003eI'm leaving Avicus and Minecraft in general. Recently I was helping a friend with a project that was focused on virtual awareness. Now virtual awareness is defined as, raising awareness against people who are constantly on technology. This caused me to sit back and look at my life and see everything I was missing out on. I lost friends, trust from family, and lots of other things. I think that my friend, even though he didn't mean to, made the video for me. Within the last two weeks I have accomplished so many things in real life and I want to make sure I focus on things, that in the long term, will allow me to change who and I am and determine what I will become. Now this goodbye will be quite long so I split it up into sections.

He basically changed my life in person and managed to make me look at things with a whole different viewpoint.

When I was a staff member I can remember all of the conversations that we had about Interstellar and Inception. We constantly showed and taught each other new things that allowed both of us to look at the movies from completely different viewpoints. He was also one of the persons who helped me get through the tough time of my father losing his job.

I had no-one to constantly just talk about my personal feelings and also the problems that are going on IRL. You helped me get through so many rough things including: My Fathers Job, a current friend situation, girl problems, and also many more things.

Well if we didn't, how would we get anything done. If you look at it, the world is based around doing new things and meeting new people. Heck, if you don't talk to strangers, you will never get a job. Cal, when I first joined teamspeak as a randy, You were the first person person that I talked to. I didn't know anybody, never knew who I would meet, but in the sight of me being alone, you stepped up and actually talked to me. I remember the first conversation that we had together and what we talked about even to this day. We applied for staff together, we served as mods together, we got demoted (not at the same time but still together), we made a build team together, we had conversations on end with each other. I don't have a brother, and the closest thing I had since I meet you was a dog named Toby. I mean my dog is great company, but you helped me define who I want to become. I dont want to trade the last five months of minecraft for any other gaming experience, in the world, all because of one person, you. Ever since Day 1 we have been friends. We have always been together and I don't ever want to lose contact with you, and I want you to be the brother that I wish I could always have. You are, my Ravish Brother.

However, it was super fun to do this. So back in the days of the last Staff Reassessment day, there formed a group. A group that decided to change the staff team for the better. We had roles, jobs, and other responsibilities to fulfill. We even had a document for the whole process and it turned out to seem pretty successful at the time. We gathered tons of information against some of the staff members and we put it all together. I was literally about to go to kylos door and have a chat with him about this. (He lives one hour away.) Here is a link to our main document if you would like to view it. (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MasevVPcri0AtktnruN3-KbYsEsdWh9eHHKrd-02f0/edit?usp=docslist_api\"\u003ehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/12MasevVPcri0AtktnruN3-KbYsEsdWh9eHHKrd-02f0/edit?usp=docslist_ap...\u003c/a\u003e) There were some things removed from the document due to confidentiality reasons, but most of it is still there. I was considered the mockingjay of the group, since I was the one no one though would be demoted. However I am not here to talk about that. I'm just here to remember all of the fun we had planning this attack and to some extent, even though we died off, it worked. It worked super successfully as well.

In case you don't know me my name is Riley and I have played on the Avicus network for almost two years now. I have enjoyed seeing the players come and go and making many friends along the way. However, I only joined the forums last December and soon after that I became a mod in January's Staff Batch which many have come to know as the \"rookie batch.\" I was absolutely loving my time as a mod and everyone said I was really nice and all that, and then I got demoted. However I don't want to talk about that, cause there isn't really a point to anyways. Now let's talk about the main point of this article.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-redactor=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-redactor=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003eI'm leaving Avicus and Minecraft in general. Recently I was helping a friend with a project that was focused on virtual awareness. Now virtual awareness is defined as, raising awareness against people who are constantly on technology. This caused me to sit back and look at my life and see everything I was missing out on. I lost friends, trust from family, and lots of other things. I think that my friend, even though he didn't mean to, made the video for me. Within the last two weeks I have accomplished so many things in real life and I want to make sure I focus on things, that in the long term, will allow me to change who and I am and determine what I will become.

Its a dream come true.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-redactor=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-redactor=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"\u003eSome of you may know that I am big into things like algorithms and that is also another thing that I am working on.

Well if we didn't, how would we get anything done. If you look at it, the world is based around doing new things and meeting new people. Heck, if you don't talk to strangers, you will never get a job. Cal, when I first joined teamspeak as a randy, You were the first person person that I talked to. I didn't know anybody, never knew who I would meet, but in the sight of me being alone, you stepped up and actually talked to me. I remember the first conversation that we had together and what we talked about even to this day. We applied for staff together, we served as mods together, we got demoted (not at the same time but still together), we made a build team together, we had conversations on end with each other. I don't have a brother, and the closest thing I had since I meet you was a dog named Toby. I mean my dog is great company, but you helped me define who I want to become. I dont want to trade the last five months of minecraft for any other gaming experience, in the world, all because of one person, you. Ever since Day 1 we have been friends. We have always been together and I don't ever want to lose contact with you, and I want you to be the brother that I wish I could always have. You are, my Ravish Brother.

However, it was super fun to do this. So back in the days of the last Staff Reassessment day, there formed a group. A group that decided to change the staff team for the better. We had roles, jobs, and other responsibilities to fulfill. We even had a document for the whole process and it turned out to seem pretty successful at the time. We gathered tons of information against some of the staff members and we put it all together. I was literally about to go to kylos door and have a chat with him about this. (He lives one hour away.) Here is a link to our main document if you would like to view it.

I was considered the mockingjay of the group, since I was the one no one though would be demoted. However I am not here to talk about that. I'm just here to remember all of the fun we had planning this attack and to some extent, even though we died off, it worked. It worked super successfully as well.
