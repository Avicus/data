Another option for me would be to take dual math, since I do have enough space in my schedule for that, and going with that would mean taking AP Calc in my senior year.

So either take AP stats, OR Honors-PreCalc.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow for the ACT and SAT. I would take the ACT. The reason is, a lot of the high-technology based schools prefer the ACT over the SAT. And, from what I have been told, the ACT is easier to boost your overall score through other categories. So I would highly recommend the ACT.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow this helps. :]","created_at":"2015/05/02 13:24:53 +0000","created_at_human":"May  2, 2015 at  1:05 PM UTC"}},{"id":185293,"unique_id":"185293-427","author":{"id":120167,"username":"Posighdun","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/89f514e1f0f549778ddc77ef030a8b46?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I would love to help you but i dont even understand what you are talking about.
