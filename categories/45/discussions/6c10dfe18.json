They may be there but no one votes for them. Simply, just bring back the McZone system... Person with\u0026nbsp;most votes\u0026nbsp;on all\u0026nbsp;websites for that month\u0026nbsp;gets diamond rank, second highest gets emerald, third highest gets gold. I enjoyed that and it definitely made me vote.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eAdvertising with the voting system is good, but not giving a rank. If we give away 3 ranks each month at some point everyone will end up getting a diamond rank. And what if there is a tie for first? Its really easy to do. Just vote every day.

The map quality is not too great. All the pretty maps get accepted. Sadly, the gameplay ain't too great on them. We should raise the standards and criteria for the maps. I have seen a few good ones get denied. The people who made them were not well known by anyone. I have also seen many crap ones get accepted. The people who made those are considered really great builders.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eI disagree, the maps look really nice and have good pvp. Yes there are a few maps I hate due to bow spamming and kill farming (ahem, Quintus) but many people enjoy more than hate it, hence it would stay. And there is a giant process for maps to getting accepted or denied. After a map becomes accepted it is not \"fully accepted\" to the rots until it is tested. Take my map for example.\u0026nbsp;\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://avicus.net/forums/07ed460a2\"\u003ehttp://avicus.net/forums/07ed460a2\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;It was accepted, but never put in the rots. Found out a few months later it was denied due to being too buggy through testing. Even if it was told accepted on the post it can always be denied after because it could be bad in action. Accepted on thread = Accepted due to looking amazing and looking like good pvp. Accepted through skype (Or silently) second time = Accepted due to looking good in game and having good pvp.
