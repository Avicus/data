I'm really bad at drawing and stuff and my friend can't do all of it by himself. I'm looking for two people to make Pokemon for me. You make the Pokemon (with a program like paint or Photoshop) and have three images of it. The view from PC's and stuff and both views from battling. Your Pokemon needs a name and a type. YOU WILL NOT BE PAID IF YOU WIN. Just going to put that out there. This is voluntary. You will be given a free copy of the game though if you win when it's complete. The game is for PC. I have a map maid and basic movement done. All I need to do now is the battle scenes and the Pokemon. Depending on the size of the Pokemon, Image 2 and 3 must be either 40 x 40, 48 x 48, 56 x 56 or 64 x 64.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAPPLICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePokemon Name:\u003cbr\u003ePokemon Type:\u003cbr\u003ePokemon Images:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImage 1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImage 2\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImage 3","body_tagged":"Hello I'm making a Pokemon game called Jotomon.
