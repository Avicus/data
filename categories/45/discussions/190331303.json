You were very friendly, talkative, funny, helpful, and ahhh just about everything you can think of! You were a good friend of mine while I was on avicus, and played a huge role in how much I enjoyed the server. Not only were you a good friend, you also helped me a \u003cb\u003etonne\u003c/b\u003e. When I first became a Jr.Mod and later Mod you gave me some incredible feedback. You were the \u003ci\u003eonly \u003c/i\u003emod who gave me good and helpful constructive criticism. I mean others did help me out as well, but you stood out \u003ci\u003efar \u003c/i\u003eabove them. So pretty much thanks for everything you've done for me, and all the time you put in as a moderator for the server.\u003cbr\u003eI'm sure you will be greatly missed by everyone here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood luck with everything! \u0026lt;3","created_at":"2016/02/25 04:29:55 +0000","created_at_human":"February 25, 2016 at  4:02 AM UTC"},{"id":282459,"unique_id":"282459-605","author":{"id":397478,"username":"RIP_Avicus","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e15cb4bb3270d67bbd6b59e0beb52748?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"No Snow!!
