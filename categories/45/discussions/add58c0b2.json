Still, the nations allied with Xanadeu had bitter taste towards its victors\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after the war, Tribes of the OVercast were united. Avicus which was known as the McZone Kingdom reformed and turned into Avicus.

Everyone at the party cheered. D00zie, a general in the Avicus army, went off to the shores to patrol. Then, they saw some new trade ships that they never seen. IT was the Overcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Overcast sent ships to open up trade in Avicus. Both Overcast and Avicus never really heard from each other and so they were, well a bit curious of each other. Then, an Overcast'an and Aviccanadian got into a fight.

Their swords clashed and both comboed well. Hotto relentlessley kept attacking but Peachy kept countering. Then they clashed swords and a loud boom rang around the island. Both of them then stopped. The soldiers on both sides were very confused \"Nice to see you again Peachy\" said Hotto \"You look just like your father.\" he responded and both shook hands\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeachy and Hotto are good childhood friends long ago and they reunited once again. \"Hows things in Avicus?\" said Hotto. \"D00zie is attempting to halt their advance towards Nebula City.

Commander TntTurtles is currently at Eta Village and they are on a sige. Hypixel's army is overwhelming but we can hold them back longer with our new tier cannons.

There was barely any cover in the beach and so, they had to dig Trenches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, Hotto and his navy landed near Senex 1.

Hotto sucessfuly captured Senex 1 and was now advancing towards Qunintus City to recapture it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eD00zie's forces encountered tough resistance. His vice- commander, \u0026nbsp;EmeraldSword in the battle of CherrylandMc, both of them fought bravely. Emerald ordred to keep firing upon enemy troops with tnt cannons. \" Shall we sword?\" said D00zie \"My pleasure.\" replied EmeraldSword. Both lead the charge and kept pushing foward. No matter what or how many forces were there, the odds did not matter to them. Both succesfully lead their men to the battle. Emerald kept fighting and he went on. He wielded his diamond sword like he knew how to use it. While he was running, he charged and went striaght for the Hypixel general. Hypixel troops were slashed and killed due to his sick sword skills \"be careful!\" said D00zie as he was blocking a sword attack \" Ok i will-\" Emerald then looked and he realized that he had been shot \"SWORD!\" screamed D00zie and he went to go check on him. \"Fire\" said the Hypixel general and arrows flew and zoomed through Avicus soldiers. Many died from the arrow barraged. \"Fire\" he said again and this time, in front of D00zie's eyes, arrows were pelted on EmeraldSword. about 60 of them pirced through his armor. D00zie was outraged. D00zie then ate a dorito chip on the floor. He was in MlG status mode.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;He charged at the enemy and enemy bodies were scattered as the power of doritos was with him \"HAS DORITOS GONE TO FAR?!?!?!?\" He then got his bow and 360 n0scoped the general. The general, so overwhlmed by the power of doritos, has fallen and died. D00zie went back to EmeraldSword. He then gave him a proper burial at CheerylandCity \"You were a friend to me.\" D00zie ordered his men to continue to move foward to Quntius, as the must retake it.

Emerald ordred to keep firing upon enemy troops with tnt cannons. \" Shall we sword?\" said D00zie \"My pleasure.\" replied EmeraldSword. Both lead the charge and kept pushing foward. No matter what or how many forces were there, the odds did not matter to them. Both succesfully lead their men to the battle. Emerald kept fighting and he went on. He wielded his diamond sword like he knew how to use it. While he was running, he charged and went striaght for the Hypixel general. Hypixel troops were slashed and killed due to his sick sword skills \"be careful!\" said D00zie as he was blocking a sword attack \" Ok i will-\" Emerald then looked and he realized that he had been shot \"SWORD!\" screamed D00zie and he went to go check on him. \"Fire\" said the Hypixel general and arrows flew and zoomed through Avicus soldiers. Many died from the arrow barraged. \"Fire\" he said again and this time, in front of D00zie's eyes, arrows were pelted on EmeraldSword. about 60 of them pirced through his armor. D00zie was outraged. D00zie then ate a dorito chip on the floor. He was in MlG status mode.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;He charged at the enemy and enemy bodies were scattered as the power of doritos was with him \"HAS DORITOS GONE TO FAR?!?!?!?\" He then got his bow and 360 n0scoped the general. The general, so overwhlmed by the power of doritos, has fallen and died. D00zie went back to EmeraldSword. He then gave him a proper burial at CheerylandCity \"You were a friend to me.\" D00zie ordered his men to continue to move foward to Quntius, as the must retake it.
