The following things I am about to say is only known by a few users, most of which are staff members.You see, when I first got Jr Mod I was a happy human being. I was nice to everyone and I loved to make people laugh and have a good time. But about 3 weeks in to being a staff member, I hit rock bottom.My depression started... My dad lost his job due to cancer. He was diagnosed with two types of cancer at once. We didn't have the money to pay it, and our insurance just wasn't enough.\u0026nbsp;They say my dad didn't have that much of a chance of making it... I started to dwell on it, I couldn't forget it. My dad was my hero at that time, I did everything with him.About a month later, my best friend killed himself. After that happened, my other best friend killed himself. I lost two of my best friends in under 1 month. I became a wreck.I didn't tell much people about it, but my life changed a lot. I became somewhat rude at times and swore a lot. I didn't talk much either, I was a robot in-game.So that went on for about 4 months, then I learned some new things happened. One of my friends got shot, the other was arrested for selling drugs. I wasn't sure what to do after that.Once I heard about that, I became very angry easily. I would snap from the easiest things ever. It majorly affected how I did my job on Avicus.When I became a Sr Mod, I was recovering, but I was still an angry person and would snap easily. I wasn't sure what I should do with my life.While recovering, I became more depressed from my school life. I wasn't ever really bullied, I wasn't ever really accepted, I was just ignored always.I got so depressed that I tried to kill myself. Not once, but multiple times. Each time I backed out because on the inside I knew I didn't want to die or I failed at it.However, I hit another turning point later. I met some new great friends and my dad managed to make it through cancer.

The main one is one that most people actually ignore and call dumb.It's one you are taught in preschool. \"Treat people the way you want to be treated.\" I've learned to treat people the way I want to be treated, from accepting all to ingoring no one.I've learned more about how I need to stop thinking my life is terrible, because there is always someone in a worse stage of life.I have mainly been touched my younger kids with cancer. I've been growing out my hair for two months now, and in Mid Feb I will be shaving my head for kids with cancer to prove to others that it is just hair and that most of these kids may never get their hair back at all due to chemo.I'm currently donating some clothes to go to homeless people that are stuck in the cold during winter and don't have winter clothing. And regardless of what they have done to become homeless, you don't fully know what happened so I wouldn't judge, they are humans too and should be treated as if they are just like us.I've learned accepting is the key and it will always come back around to do you good.Now regarding all people that think I \"hate\" them, I'm sorry.
