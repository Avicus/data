There's always some debate over Dubstep vs. Classical, or even Dubstep vs. Anything, once you think about it. Personally I enjoy Dubstep; many people don't realize how technical and intricate most dubstep really is. The placement of kicks, snares, and hi-hats, the sound design and engineering of the electronically produced wobble bass synths, and not to mention the lengthy and often tedious process of mixing and mastering everything. Dubstep is one of the most difficult genres of EDM (and music in general) to produce simply because of how much work must be put into these tracks, and the artists who create great dub step tracks are very talented people and should be respected (excluding a few people *coughskrillexcough*.) And if you think \"dub step\" is all robotic sex noises and annoying mechanical noises, there are many types of dub step out there - the one you are talking about is most likely \"brostep,\" somewhat of a sub-genre of the original dubstep that developed in the Americas and features heavier, more \"electronic\" sounding bass drops and synth noises. Things like chill step, melodic dubstep, and even drum step often feature more melodic and soothing synths versus UK dubstep and bro-step. But, if you feel that dubstep is not your music, I cannot change that and I have no intent on changing it. Listen to what you desire, but keep an open mind (and open ears.) It might just change your mind ;)","body_tagged":"Many people don't like dubstep - I respect that.
