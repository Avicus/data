Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it.

Apparently this is too strict even though players have about 5-6 chances to stop and avoid punishment. If anything it is good that we verbal warn first so why complain?

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3.

We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eCerealFirst\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003ehas failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord.

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban.

We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop.

As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3.

We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context?

Again, I will say I do not intend to be offensive to anyone I replied to, but this is me clearing myself up and explaining myself instead of being quiet like I usually am on what I do.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","created_at":"2017/05/05 05:43:46 +0000","created_at_human":"May  5, 2017 at  5:05 AM UTC"},{"id":368309,"unique_id":"368309-2238","author":{"id":511990,"username":"Riilo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/63b88dffc6b44e08bd17aae089b12e95?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"First!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg class=\"image-viewer horizontal\" src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/6b525f782531aa3cde64d96e3367464a.png\" style=\"visibility: visible; max-width: 79px; max-height: 100%;\" title=\"Image: https://i.gyazo.com/6b525f782531aa3cde64d96e3367464a.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eholy shit\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http://www.eiremed.ie/bmz_cache/6/68fa3eadb2b111eb534e6d7bf59c7969.image.733x550.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for fingers bleeding\" onload=\"google.aft\u0026amp;\u0026amp;google.aft(this)\" width=\"733\" height=\"550\" style=\"margin-top: 64px;\" title=\"Image: http://www.eiremed.ie/bmz_cache/6/68fa3eadb2b111eb534e6d7bf59c7969.image.733x550.jpg\"\u003e","body_tagged":"First!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg class=\"image-viewer horizontal\" src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/6b525f782531aa3cde64d96e3367464a.png\" style=\"visibility: visible; max-width: 79px; max-height: 100%;\" title=\"Image: https://i.gyazo.com/6b525f782531aa3cde64d96e3367464a.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eholy shit\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http://www.eiremed.ie/bmz_cache/6/68fa3eadb2b111eb534e6d7bf59c7969.image.733x550.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for fingers bleeding\" onload=\"google.aft\u0026amp;\u0026amp;google.aft(this)\" width=\"733\" height=\"550\" style=\"margin-top: 64px;\" title=\"Image: http://www.eiremed.ie/bmz_cache/6/68fa3eadb2b111eb534e6d7bf59c7969.image.733x550.jpg\"\u003e","created_at":"2017/05/05 06:06:39 +0000","created_at_human":"May  5, 2017 at  6:05 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":368308,"unique_id":"368308-2921","author":{"id":497178,"username":"twopump","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/58b9ab0f83cf43c1b53baecd64ed2838?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Btw, this will be a long post and I left a note at the end.

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different.

This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3.

We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context?

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context.

My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that \"L\" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state \"L\" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eCerealFirst\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003ehas failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord.

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context.

What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people.

Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way.

You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies.

For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context?

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban.

We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context.

What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people.

Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e.

As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different.

This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons.

The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eCerealFirst\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003ehas failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord.

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context.

What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people.

Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3.

You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context?

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context.

What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3.

You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context?

Again, I will say I do not intend to be offensive to anyone I replied to, but this is me clearing myself up and explaining myself instead of being quiet like I usually am on what I do.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","created_at":"2017/05/05 05:43:46 +0000","created_at_human":"May  5, 2017 at  5:05 AM UTC"}},{"id":368336,"unique_id":"368336-2602","author":{"id":154881,"username":"DaGoldBrick","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b87bf176bc134915a43b9794573096ee?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"ok, I expect you to warn/kick/temp ban for all the other letters in the alphabet for consistency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'll expect other players to not challenge it after they get banned either, because they'll know that it's fucking retarded.","body_tagged":"ok, I expect you to warn/kick/temp ban for all the other letters in the alphabet for consistency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'll expect other players to not challenge it after they get banned either, because they'll know that it's fucking retarded.","created_at":"2017/05/05 11:14:56 +0000","created_at_human":"May  5, 2017 at 11:05 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":368288,"unique_id":"368288-2963","author":{"id":534793,"username":"TooSweetSki","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/d25689cfb96a42e194cc3a397f0dd567?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eI'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eYou didn't expect to get banned after you got warned and kicked?\u003cbr\u003elol ok\u003c/span\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eI'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eYou didn't expect to get banned after you got warned and kicked?\u003cbr\u003elol ok\u003c/span\u003e","created_at":"2017/05/05 03:03:56 +0000","created_at_human":"May  5, 2017 at  3:05 AM UTC"}},{"id":368345,"unique_id":"368345-3898","author":{"id":18535,"username":"Goodnighht","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/18056f6655144dec9cb885d052e1d54c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"You sir just gained a lot of respect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHenry followed the guildlines he was given when he passed his interview, not his fault.

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it.

As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -\u0026gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -\u0026gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context.

What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3.

We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context?

Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eyou actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop.

As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”.

As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial.

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eMEANING\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying \"why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?\", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@SamuelJacob9 - correct\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that \"L\" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state \"L\" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule.

A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eCerealFirst\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003ehas failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord.
