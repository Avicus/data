Now again AE has a better rendering quality (For me). However requiring a good CPU and GPU (If GPU is listed in the rendering section). And adding motion blur is also going to be easier, due to Sony Vegas having this pink bar, which you dont know where to place, AE offers a better way, from 1-100 you can select how much motion blur you can have.
