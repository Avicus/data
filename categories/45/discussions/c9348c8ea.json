They do such a great deal of work on this server, and I appreciate that. It really makes the server great when the community is great, which is what the staff do. They always are right onto it and helpful, and seem to always know what to do in any situation. They are kind and helpful. I see tones of staff helping and dealing with problems around the server and decided I should thank them for all their hard work. They do it for the server, not for personal benefit. I really enjoy this server, and thats probably because of them. Thought I'd take a moment to thank all of the staff out there, from Jr Mods to Admins. You all do great work and really deserve a thanks. Keep up the good work :) -Mx","body_tagged":"I just wanted to take a little moment to thank all the staff on Avicus.
