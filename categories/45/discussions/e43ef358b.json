And if you're so intent on getting new games on Avicus then give some ideas instead of complaining that we have none. Walls started Avicus, and Keenan isn't about to let it go away. I get it if you don't like the gamemode, but adding gamemodes that some people left because they were removed, is a good way to not only get players back, but get new players that like those gamemodes as well. Knockback and hit detection was a big reason a lot of people left, and both of those have gotten much, much better in Atlas.
