I apologize for not being active in the forums, and on the server. I am currently on a sick leave, because I caught a fever. Anyways, let's stay on topic, shall we? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have browsed on the internet for MCPE Master for iOS, because I saw lots of my friends playing with it at school. Of course they were using either Samsung S5, Samsung J5, etc. Then I thought of this. Maybe I should ask you guys this question: Do you by any chance know where I can get that? I really want it, and I am trying to find it but I was wondering if you guys can give me any clues, or hints as to where it is to be found. If you can't, I won't blame you because it is not your fault. Your help will be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you very much, I hope you guys have a nice day, bye! (I might come back from being AFK and play with you guys! YAY!)","body_tagged":"Hello everyone! I apologize for not being active in the forums, and on the server.
