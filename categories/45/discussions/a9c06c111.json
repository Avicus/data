Make sure they have good reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALso, I know I usually insist on people get a fair amount of ram, but there is no way you need 16gb's, unless you plan on doing renders, and even then, 8gbs and 16gbs will have barely any difference in speed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to get a brand new PC, you should go with _Phyres build, it will easily do what you want.","created_at":"2015/07/22 20:22:43 +0000","created_at_human":"July 22, 2015 at  8:07 PM UTC"},{"id":210666,"unique_id":"210666-262","author":{"id":306139,"username":"Loo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/dd725af0c6604eb6be334aca40897048?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003ca href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/phJkZL\" title=\"Link: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/phJkZL\"\u003ehttp://pcpartpicker.com/p/phJkZL\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;(With monitor)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VgmxvK\" title=\"Link: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VgmxvK\"\u003ehttp://pcpartpicker.com/p/VgmxvK\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;(Without monitor)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI highly recommend the second build, it will be much better at recording/rendering than the first one, it has a better CPU and GPU.\u0026nbsp;I don't know if you need a monitor or not, but if you do, try to see if you can use a small TV or something.

thermal compound, VGA cables,\u0026nbsp;SATA cables if they aren't provided.\u003cbr\u003e-Windows 10 might be a better choice.\u003cbr\u003e-If you already have an old PC, you could easily recycle some parts such as the RAM, optical drive, hard drive, monitor, etc.. to save more money or use for better upgrades.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e-Make sure to buy from trusted people on Ebay. People who have lots of reviews and a good satisfaction percentage.\u003cbr\u003e-At anytime, people could purchase the product before you get your hands on it. \u003cbr\u003e-You won't need the USB adapter if you only use Ethernet.\u003cbr\u003e*Also, I only know the basics to computer building so I need someone to confirm that this build will work xD.\u003cbr\u003e*If you use somebody else's build, you should find the parts on Ebay because they will likely have the same part for a much cheaper price compared to Newegg.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'Helvetica neue', Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248);\"\u003e\u003ch1 class=\"it-ttl\" itemprop=\"name\" id=\"itemTitle\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 18px; display: inline;\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"g-hdn\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 0px; font-weight: normal; height: 0px; line-height: 0; outline: none medium; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; width: 0px; z-index: -1;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","created_at":"2015/07/24 07:33:11 +0000","created_at_human":"July 24, 2015 at  7:07 AM UTC"}]}
