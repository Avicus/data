So, we headed out for the sea to do the actual scuba diving and after we made it to our destination at sea we put our gear on and jumped out. After about 10 minutes I was about 50 feet underwater with the rest of the group exploring the coral reef and hidden sea life.

I walked a little deeper, and got over being scared (a little :P) Then, VERY quickly, My dog yanks the leash and begins barking at something in the trees, I just thought It was a animal so thought nothing of it and quieted my dog. Thats when I began to want to leave, but for some strange reason,maybe I was to scared or something, I couldnt figure the way out(I know the woods by heart) I started to run to what seemed to be the right path,It was, but then my dog really wanted to get over next to a tree and bark at something, But I tugged her away. I was close to the entrance when I looked back... I dont know what it was, maybe a alien or a ghost, But I seen something to appear as a short human just standing there. I forgot to tell you guys this but my woods is right next to a cementary..\u0026nbsp; :'( I ran the heck out of the woods to find my self right in the Cementary, It appeared to be another figure, but i ignored it .-.
