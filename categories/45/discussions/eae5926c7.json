Also as a Bayern fan their performance against Benfica was underwhelming. They could have probably won it with ease on any day but the effort they had to put in wasn't there. Although both goals pretty much unavoidable I think players like Lewandowski who usually have a major impact on the game didn't do enough. The City vs PSG game was also delightful to watch as I got to see a team about 30 points clear in first place get beaten by a team that hadn't made it this far into the champions league (for a while if I'm correct perhaps not at all).

First of all, Atletico will probably beat Bayern. Bayern were lazy last match, and although Pep will give everyone a good smacking in the changing rooms they might lack the work effort to beat a team with a strong defense and an attack lead by Griezmann who will continue to tear goalkeepers new assholes. I also believe that they will play Real in the finals because of the home advantage and Ronaldo's tendency to score screamers whenever he damn well feels like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewish arsenal were still in it but unfortunately if they're finishing fourth in their own league how can the finish first in the champions league come on giroud and Walcott go to mls already","body_tagged":"Opinions on what has happened so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'm happy with these results. I'm glad Barcelona lost because now they can't win, it becomes so predictable when you have a team as good as Barcelona playing against teams that they've beaten multiple times in the past (apart from Atletico). Also as a Bayern fan their performance against Benfica was underwhelming. They could have probably won it with ease on any day but the effort they had to put in wasn't there. Although both goals pretty much unavoidable I think players like Lewandowski who usually have a major impact on the game didn't do enough. The City vs PSG game was also delightful to watch as I got to see a team about 30 points clear in first place get beaten by a team that hadn't made it this far into the champions league (for a while if I'm correct perhaps not at all). Finally the Real Madrid game started with a scare but finished as expect thx Ronaldo pls have my babies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions on what's happening now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far City have tied with Real. I missed the game unfortunately but I think this is a good result for them considering both Madrid sides are in good form right now. I'm not sure whether or not that was a home game, but if it was then City have to really prove themselves away in Spain since it will be a major test scoring and not conceding, or at least tying.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions on what is going to happen:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk here are my predictions for the finals, alright. First of all, Atletico will probably beat Bayern.

Iheanacho is a very good player but I don't think he can provide the same creativity to break the likes of Ramos and Pepe. In addition Real Madrid has gotten better since then, improving their form and if they keep that they'll probably end up in the finals. That being said, this game is unpredictable and anything can happen. Id love to see City move on and an English team win again but it seems fairly unlikely.","body_tagged":"Well now David Silva is injured and could be out next game.
