I also think that if people pay 10-50 dollars for an unban, they are less likely to hack because they know they spent money and don't want to waste it. Another thing, If they pay to get back on, it could also show that they seem to like the server enough to spend money for it, which probably means they don't want to risk being permanently banned.

Senior Moderators put all their effort into making players wait a certain amount of time so they learn what they did wrong and all that. Making unbans buyable would just scrap that time. Also it would, even if it's not the 90% but the 10%, make mods waste their time in punishing a player again. Rulebreakers are already a pain and punishing them takes its time to get the proof, ban, maybe look at an appeal, I really don't want to increase that not even by a 1%.","created_at":"2015/07/27 11:07:56 +0000","created_at_human":"July 27, 2015 at 11:07 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":211910,"unique_id":"211910-4482","author":{"id":378816,"username":"badgg","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c913d72d7140d19b0bee41c5e2f72b45?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"As robin stated, how are you SOO sure that player who purchase an unban will break the rules again?
