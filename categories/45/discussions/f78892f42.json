I'm humorous at times, and many people that know me say I have a very strong sense of logic and am very good at arguing a point using that logic. Erm.... For sports I'm good at posting up. I also play soccer and am alright at it. I also started playing baseball this year on a team. I'm good at crafts such as origami, and making items such as foam swords and many other things. Im also just a fast learner.","created_at":"2014/07/26 13:18:44 +0000","created_at_human":"July 26, 2014 at  1:07 PM UTC"},{"id":49936,"unique_id":"49936-2836","author":{"id":204540,"username":"Shadowbladz","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/011e7779c1af43ac872009d15b170a39?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003eI'm described as \"near-genius\" when it comes to mathematical problem solving ^_^","body_tagged":"\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003eI'm described as \"near-genius\" when it comes to mathematical problem solving ^_^","created_at":"2014/07/26 13:22:14 +0000","created_at_human":"July 26, 2014 at  1:07 PM UTC"},{"id":49979,"unique_id":"49979-3209","author":{"id":108,"username":"MLGtino","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5855cb2b462f42969c1e685db0ecd987?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I can do one of those Asian accents you might see on Ownage pranks xD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt creeps people out a bit but I like to see the reactions \\(^•^)/","body_tagged":"I can do one of those Asian accents you might see on Ownage pranks xD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt creeps people out a bit but I like to see the reactions \\(^•^)/","created_at":"2014/07/26 15:24:25 +0000","created_at_human":"July 26, 2014 at  3:07 PM UTC"},{"id":49983,"unique_id":"49983-1559","author":{"id":57843,"username":"TheOpAmerican","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fa0a790c10a56aad509fb49e03add66?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"uh, i'm fast and I can dribble a soccer ball","body_tagged":"uh, i'm fast and I can dribble a soccer ball","created_at":"2014/07/26 15:38:08 +0000","created_at_human":"July 26, 2014 at  3:07 PM UTC"},{"id":49999,"unique_id":"49999-2817","author":{"id":354547,"username":"BoldAndBrash","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5a0b55defddb448caf5070856cbf39ee?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"\\/\\/r1gh71ng 570r135\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting stories","body_tagged":"\\/\\/r1gh71ng 570r135\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting stories","created_at":"2014/07/26 16:10:30 +0000","created_at_human":"July 26, 2014 at  4:07 PM UTC"},{"id":50007,"unique_id":"50007-2729","author":{"id":15915,"username":"_Laugh_","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/262d8d673add4f06a7f5aa11263d6996?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Sometimes by body has super human reflexes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt happens randomly and many people go \"how'd he do that?\"","body_tagged":"Sometimes by body has super human reflexes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt happens randomly and many people go \"how'd he do that?\"","created_at":"2014/07/26 16:24:37 +0000","created_at_human":"July 26, 2014 at  4:07 PM UTC"},{"id":50492,"unique_id":"50492-1244","author":{"id":122420,"username":"ledluap","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9ee7672480894f3cb920ec53ae050261?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"nothing much basketball i guess\u003cBR\u003e","body_tagged":"nothing much basketball i guess\u003cBR\u003e","created_at":"2014/07/27 07:43:53 +0000","created_at_human":"July 27, 2014 at  7:07 AM UTC"},{"id":50493,"unique_id":"50493-1936","author":{"id":122420,"username":"ledluap","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9ee7672480894f3cb920ec53ae050261?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"i play basketball, i guess im good at that","body_tagged":"i play basketball, i guess im good at that","created_at":"2014/07/27 07:50:06 +0000","created_at_human":"July 27, 2014 at  7:07 AM UTC"},{"id":50495,"unique_id":"50495-1232","author":{"id":110701,"username":"Potato0001","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/e76a7cfc6449436eaba0cebd82c7fc85?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Im kind of Psychic, i have Déjà vu almost every night, not really a talent but its creepy","body_tagged":"Im kind of Psychic, i have Déjà vu almost every night, not really a talent but its creepy","created_at":"2014/07/27 07:59:13 +0000","created_at_human":"July 27, 2014 at  7:07 AM UTC"},{"id":50498,"unique_id":"50498-265","author":{"id":3845,"username":"Sphrynax","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/97eb98011f844c6e87bc85e3afe32adc?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"OMG!
