So if you can, give anyone or the whole team positive vibes, if something frustrates you, don't take it out on others just say dang or gg to the other person cause really GG, but never give negative attention because the negative cloud wont go away and it will pass onto others, and if someone's getting uncomfortable because of positive vibes then okay just move on, that's not something to shut down about.
