Wait, or would having high FOV make it seem like it curves more because there's more of a sensitive warp with your vision? I play at 87, so I don't have any idea.

If you hold it down for .5 seconds, you'll make a weak shot that curves. It also appears to curve more drastically when making far shots. If I'm correct, the ratio of movement to curvature is about the same, except since it's on a bigger scale, it's more noticeable. Due to this, when you shoot someone near you, the arrow doesn't curve much because it's not traveling a long distance.","body_tagged":"Yes, Cinnamon may be correct.
