Next get full diamond or full iron (preferably diamond). Next get to the other teams side. Then if there's other people in full diamond on your team there you can stay in the glass cube and kill the leather guys who come into the glass cube. If your by yourself dig a tunnel under ground. Make sure you have lots of wood, a sword and an axe on your hot bar. Next attract leather players or iron players if your in diamond armor. Bring them into the tunnel and block hit and jump against the top of the tunnel and kill them. Repeat this and stack up on kills. If your low on hearts simply spam wood in front of you, run and regenerate your health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this helps some people :).
