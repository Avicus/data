And many people notice that i lift weights at gym so they generally try not to fight me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#3: I am assertive when needed and do not back down from fights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust remember, try to be assertive and do not always trust teachers as 50% of the time (Depending on the school and teachers) they won't do anything. Alright? Don't let them bully you and tell the teachers to do their jobs correctly if they do not do anything.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your parents are called for this reason, then tell the parents exactly why you said that and they will agree with you. This will hopefully get your teachers to try to do disciplinary actions more.","created_at":"2014/09/30 14:35:25 +0000","created_at_human":"September 30, 2014 at  2:09 PM UTC"}},{"id":94052,"unique_id":"94052-3806","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"Not really sure why this is on a Minecraft gaming forum but good message.","body_tagged":"Not really sure why this is on a Minecraft gaming forum but good message.","created_at":"2014/10/01 00:18:52 +0000","created_at_human":"October  1, 2014 at 12:10 AM UTC"},{"id":94072,"unique_id":"94072-394","author":{"id":217583,"username":"winterice123","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/0c34bc3390104b2090159d1bbdffac63?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Yo, im a junior in high school, and ima just tell you right here right now dont get yo shit mixed up in a fight.
