Your people wanted to make an Armenia country and Turkish people didn't let you and sent you out of the country. In Turkish schools, they teach it as something nice. But I've always though that we should let people create their own countries. And they teach us like France, Italy and England are bad countries. I just wanna move out of this fucking country. People suck, education suck, president suck EVERYTHING SUX HERE OMG","created_at":"2016/07/16 12:56:47 +0000","created_at_human":"July 16, 2016 at 12:07 PM UTC"}},{"id":318400,"unique_id":"318400-1344","author":{"id":433210,"username":"flyofff","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6a6c3550d4c7467a92b658755d7a945b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"So true.
