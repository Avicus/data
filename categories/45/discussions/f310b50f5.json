This means that they won't notice you for about 7 hits which may even be able to kill the player. The other best reason to use critical hits is to use them after a hit going foward call a \"Straightline Combo\" which we will further more discuss later in this forum. after about 3 hits of this \"Straightline Combo\" who should start jumping and keep on knocking them back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eShould NOT:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Players should almost never use critical hits while having the effect speed on them for it will olny get you comboed.

This tactic is very good but also bad in some ways. When block hitting your speed is majorly slower making it harder to chase a running player. If you keep spamming this it may not get you a combo but just a normal hit and block for it will keep on decreasing your speed. When you block hit it makes the player take more knock back allowing you to quickly stop block hitting and run up and chase the player to combo them. If you do quick block hit then remove the block it will hardly damage your speed. Block hitting is best used in tight spaces because you won't take knock back from being cornered into a wall and from taking less damage and still hitting .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSprint Key\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThe sprint key allows you to hold down one to sprint without having to press 'w' twice. This helps you do parkour while pvping and extremely helps your pvping with sword. You can find your sprint key next to \"Sprint\" in \"Controls\" all inside of your options. I would most recommend setting your sprint key to something you press with your pinky finger so the other fingers don't have to do anything to activate it. I would also recommend that if you have a mouse with buttons on the side or top you could set your sprint key for that button because you only use 2/5 fingers with your left hand on the mouse. The best way to use your sprint key is to hold it down the whole fight. Since human bodys have muscle memory or the ability to remeber when our muscles are doing you will quickly become use to you sprint key even if it's uncomfortable at first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eCombo:\u003c/b\u003e A combo is the process of you landing many hits on your enemy when they don't hit you at all.

If you learn how to strafe you look at Pvping in a whole different way. There are many ways to strafe that will completely confuse your enemy and yourself because of how good it feels when a strafe works, here are some ways to strafe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eStraightline Strafing\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e is basically moving forward while constantly hitting. This strafe requires the least amount of skill but can be amazing when it works. The best way to preform a straightline strafe is to hold and let go of your 'w' key allowing it to stunt your sprint key formation putting the knockback on the player at a larger amound. Although Straightlining relys on one's internet speed the most it also relys on skill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eStraightline Block Hit Strafing\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e is using the straightline strafe while block hitting once or twice to give the enemy a large amount of knock back the going forward with your sprint key and rapidly pressing 'w'.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eStraightline Crit Strafing\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e is using straightline strafing for one or two hits then using critical hits to deal massive damage.

This is amazingly hard to preform because you have to do it perfectly on the time of the hit.

This hits the enemy all around confuses them so much that they may accuse you of cheating after doing it. While doing this you may have to change rotation if the players head starts to catch up with your movement. This strafe does not rely on internet speed that much at all but highly on skill. This strafe may take week or even months of practice to preform this strafe. This strafe may be practicly impossible to preform perfectly without speed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eSemi-Circle Strafing\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e is like full circle strafing except with only doing a half circle or less.

To anticipate an action when someone's running, I recommend shooting about 5 blocks in front of the person depending on how they run and how far away you are, and your ping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSniping:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eSniping is the art of hitting people without anyone noticing your presence earlier. I recommend staying at least 30 blocks away from your target to avoid your shots from being dodged. Experiment with a few shots; they're hard to notice, and give you a good idea of what angle to hit. Once you find that angle, shoot from that angle as much as you can before your target moves, and adjust appropriately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eClose Combat Shooting:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThere are two parts to close combat shooting: bow spamming and shots before a swordfight.\u003cbr\u003eBow spamming is the act of shooting a lot of arrows in a short period of time; honestly, I don't recommend it because it's unsteady and can be avoided easily, but if you have a steady hand, go ahead!\u003cbr\u003eShooting an arrow or two before you go into combat with your sword is a tactic that I use to get an advantage over other players; it weakens them and slows them down, giving you quite the advantage. I recommend using hotkeys for this; scrolling just isn't good enough for this situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eShooting on the Run\u003c/b\u003e: Shooting on the run is more of a last resort tactic; when you have low health and need to run, this will slow down your enemies. It's a little tricky at first; you have to make sure you rotate a perfect 180 degrees to hit your enemy, and make sure to run again after you shoot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003ePing:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThe final section I'll cover is ping. As explained in the original post, ping shows your connection to the server. Normally, a very good ping is needed to be good with the bow, or else your shots become very inaccurate.
