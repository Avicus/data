What I'm trying to say is, I will be playing in the mornings now and set a time of when to stop playing and if I'm playing at night set a time for when to stop, this is because I have been having negative dreams and I'm having worry about what's going on in my life and they end up in my dreams and turn into nightmares which is causing me to clench my teeth in my sleep or wake up from a nightmare crying which has my jaw hurting so bad it's hard to eat food, so Game time will be short I will still play but it wont be till 11 pm 12 am so please don't say, \"Kizzy, please do this map with me\" because I will get sucked in and say \"Okay!\" I am going to be straight with you guys and say no I need to go to bed now. I need to get my sleep schedule back(going to bed at 8), thanks fam!","body_tagged":"Okay, since I have been back playing I noticed I stay up till 11pm or 12 am and that's pretty late for me but when I was 13- 17 I'd stay up till 5 am well that's not happening anymore, ever since I graduated from high school and was 18 at the time and now 19 and going on anxiety medicine I noticed I need sleep.
