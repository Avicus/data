I understand that people do consider these type of messages spam, and I completely respect and understand their opinion on that, and that is why I include in all messages \"If you would like to not be notified about these messages feel free to turn off notifications from me or delete me\" Because I know for a fact 90% Of my fan skype wants those messages there, and I apoligise but I will not stop sending them if you individually do not like them, when you can easily remove me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. I am not a \"Sub Whore\" Incase you don't know what a sub whore is, my belief is basically that it is an individual that tells people do subscribe to them all the time and they don't care about making videos, their content or anything. They just care about getting subscribers. Now this is probably the thing I laugh at the most considering I do daily uploads, have spent well over $1,000 on YouTube and I get barely anything out of it. I only have 500 subscribers, I am still a relatively small channel. I make approximately $0.30 Per video. That's thirty cents. It's close to nothing. The fact of it is, I don't care about the money.. Of course eventually it would be nice to make a little pocket money out of youtube because its something I am very passionate about and I love doing but seriously? I'm just doing this for fun, and to entertain people. I love doing this, and that's why I do it. Not to gain subscribers, not for money... none of that. I love this, and it's as simple as that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously people are going to take offence to this because I am speaking the truth and sometimes the truth can be annoying to some people. But hear me out guys, every one of you reading this. Every single one of you... I have absolutely nothing against you, I just like making videos. And as for the topics on Avicus about my videos is well... I still have a lot of fans on Avicus, and if you look at my threads I get a lot of negative feedback, it seems the only people that don't like it are some individual staff members. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the IMPORTANT PART: I want to make Avicus videos, I really, really do.
