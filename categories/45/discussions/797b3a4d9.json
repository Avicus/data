Anyways please bring back Elimination and don't remove it. If you look at my xp wheel 3/4 of my distribution is Elimination lol. I also really liked MC Zone's HG I found it more fun than Elim because there would be less \"Orc's\" =_= but Elimination is good because you can have like over 20 kits lol. Anyways BRING BACK ELIMINATION.","created_at":"2014/06/29 20:43:51 +0000","created_at_human":"June 29, 2014 at  8:06 PM UTC"},{"id":28849,"unique_id":"28849-1572","author":{"id":3453,"username":"build_high","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6369af3c96324c1d81be990de7a017ac?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Soup is shit,\u003cbr\u003eit makes battles last till someone runs out of soup (2 mins) and makes battles like kit Poseidon.","body_tagged":"Soup is shit,\u003cbr\u003eit makes battles last till someone runs out of soup (2 mins) and makes battles like kit Poseidon.","created_at":"2014/06/30 09:42:00 +0000","created_at_human":"June 30, 2014 at  9:06 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":26315,"unique_id":"26315-142","author":{"id":1175,"username":"ViolentBoo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/91ae8594b1d147c3ba68b23a8f2cb9d1?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"No we are not having soup.
