It's a little story based on something my grandmother told me XD. I saw EnderPearlReaper posting some horror stories on the forums, and I thought I'd post this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eHide and Seek\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving into new apartments had always\r\nstressed me out. There were so many factors to take into account- the new\r\nneighbors, the possibility of unforeseen mechanical issues (such as leaky\r\nfaucets), odd smells coming from the walls, etc. As a result, I always\r\nthoroughly checked out my lodgings before I decided to move in. As it so\r\nhappened, I’d recently been fired, and had found an apartment which was far\r\ncloser to my favorite food market than my current one- and it was cheaper. So I\r\nwent to check it out.\r\n\r\n\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003cbr\u003eThe apartment in question was D4, on the\r\nfourth floor of the building it was located in. The previous tenant had left\r\nsome time ago and the building’s manager was showing me around. It certainly\r\nwasn’t anything too fancy- it had a kitchen, a bathroom, single bedroom, blah\r\nblah blah. It was pretty much the same as my old one, only slightly smaller. I\r\nguess that explained the reduced rent- although it was still lower than it\r\nshould have been. I checked the walls, the faucets, the gas- everything was in\r\nfine working order. There didn’t seem to be any particular reason for the lower\r\nrent. But I didn’t really worry too much- it might have been low, but it wasn’t\r\ncheap. In hindsight, I guess I should have questioned the manager more closely\r\nthan I did about the apartment’s history.\u003c/span\u003e\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; So I moved in. And for the first few weeks,\r\neverything was fine. There were noises which came through the walls- sounds of\r\ncooking in the apartment to the left of mine, a child’s happy little voice from\r\nthe unit above, and sounds of people talking through the wall of the apartment\r\non the right. My old building had similar noises- I could hear the television\r\nin the next room, I could hear the shower from below, etc. All in all, this was\r\na pretty regular apartment building. The first sign of trouble was when my\r\nneighbors threw me a housewarming party to welcome me to the building. That in\r\nitself wasn’t the problem- they were all nice people, and their food was\r\nabsolutely delicious. \r\n\r\n\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eThe problem started when we began making\r\nsmall talk. As it turned out, the people living in the apartments to the right\r\nand left of mine were married couples, all of whom held jobs, meaning they were\r\nout during the day. The apartments above and under mine were both vacant. When\r\nI asked them about the noises I could hear- the cooking, the voices, and the\r\nchild, they gave me odd looks. There was no child living in any of the\r\napartments close to mine. And nobody was in them during the day, so the voices\r\ncouldn’t be real either. What made it worse was when one of the men laughed and\r\nsaid, “The old tenant used to say similar things, didn’t he? Always going on\r\nabout hearing a child somewhere.” \u003c/span\u003e\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Alarm bells went off in my head. This was\r\nnot something to take lightly. I held in my worries till the end of the party,\r\nthen started my research into my own apartment. My first stop was the old\r\nlibrary a couple blocks away. As it turned out, that was the perfect place to\r\ngo. I met the librarian, an ancient lady who looked as though she could have\r\nbeen Caesar’s grandmother, and she perked up considerably when I mentioned\r\napartment D4. “Ah, D4 did you say? Well, you might wanna sit down, sunny. I got\r\na grand old tale to tell you ‘bout that place.”\r\n\r\n\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; I sat down in a comfortable armchair and\r\nwaited. \u003cbr\u003eThe old woman began. “T’was the summer of 1985. The apartment building\r\nyou’re currently living in was being built at the time, and it was being built\r\nunder a very tight schedule. None of the workers could afford to waste any time\r\non the job, and they rushed their work a bit. At the same time, a little girl\r\nnamed Ruby Ellis used to play in the empty lot where the site of the building\r\nis now.” The old woman pulled out a tattered photograph, which showed a very\r\nyoung girl, about six or seven years old. She was wearing a dress, and laughing\r\nat the camera. It was a bit creepy, to be honest.\u003c/span\u003e\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “Ruby used to play hide-and-seek in the\r\ntall grass where the building is now. Of course, that was when the lot was\r\nempty and unused. When the construction workers showed up, Ruby kept on going\r\nto the site and playing by herself. Her friends wouldn’t go near the place with\r\nall the people there, and the workers were always so rushed that they barely\r\nnoticed her. And so, one day, the inevitable happened. The workers were filling\r\nin a room on the fourth floor with cement, and they heard a *glub glub* sound\r\nthat shouldn’t have been there. When they eventually realized what had\r\nhappened, it was far, far too late to do anything about it. They had so little\r\ntime in their schedule, they couldn’t even do proper funeral rites for Ruby,\r\nand her family never got her body. Of course, its been a long time since then,\r\nand there can’t be much left of her corpse now. Physically, that is.”\r\n\r\n\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003cbr\u003eI looked at the woman. I knew what she was\r\ngetting at. “Some say that Ruby Ellis is still in that building, in the general\r\narea of room D4. You’re not the first to report weird noises in that room, you\r\nknow.” I thanked the old woman for her story, and told her I needed to be\r\ngetting back. She handed me the picture of the girl, and told me to keep it. I\r\nobliged, and hurried back to my apartment. Ghosts. What a load of baloney! The\r\nstory had been interesting, which is why I’d listened, but I didn’t believe a\r\nword of it. Too far-fetched. Although……I stared at the walls of my apartment.\r\nThere were always weird noises in buildings, particularly ones as old as this,\r\nbut the noises I heard were so distinct, there was no way they weren’t real. I\r\ngrew restless. Hah! Ghost. No way, there was no way, no fricking way……right?\u003c/span\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; I had to be sure. There was one way I could\r\ntry. Looking back, I guess it wasn’t the smartest thing to do, but listening to\r\nthe old lady’s story had kind of freaked me out a bit. I could hide in the\r\nbathroom at night. If the girl was still playing hide and seek, she’d come out\r\nat night. I’d just have to wait for her, and she’d show up. Of course, that\r\nwouldn’t happen, because everyone knows that ghosts aren’t real. So I did it. \u003cbr\u003eI\r\nhid in the bathroom, at night, with the lights off. It was the most unnerving\r\nfeeling I have ever experienced in my life. At first I could hear the sounds of\r\nthe couple next door laughing with each other. But then came the time for\r\neveryone to go to bed. As the noises faded, one by one, all I could hear were\r\nthe clock in the living room and the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;The night dragged on, and nothing was\r\nhappening. My eyes began to droop, and my mind was feeling a little fuzzy.\r\nThen, from outside the bathroom door, came the unmistakable sounds of a child\r\nrunning through the room. There were the footfalls, and the soft laughter that\r\nonly little girls can pull off. I was sure I’d locked all the entrances to the\r\napartment, but the sound continued. I gulped. No way, there was no way…….I\r\ninched open the bathroom door carefully. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I rubbed\r\nthem, and blinked hard. But they were seeing clearly. I’d found the girl from\r\nthe picture. But in doing so, I’d completely forgotten the most important rule\r\nof hide and seek………once you find somebody………it’s their turn to find you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you liked it.
