As some of you may know I have made a lot of video, over 100 to be exact. Most of the videos are influenced heavily by Avicus and the community that's apart of it, so you guys! When I first announced me thinking about deleting the videos and starting again it was an idea I came up with spontaneously. As time went on I gathered more reasons to go through with the idea, and it seems like a lot of you don't yet fully understand why I would want to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had lot's of negativity around the idea and I needed to address it. My main reason is to become/look like a much more professional channel, with most of my videos I hope they look professional because that's what I want them to be like. But to most of you restarting for only this reason may seem like a bad idea but I am looking towards the future and you are looking into the past.

They would most likely show their best, and the ones they don't like they might keep but do nothing about it.

And since not every mod seems like they want to change things the progression seems quite slow. Slowly but surely things will be changed but by that time I feel a lot of players and regulars will have left. The best way to try and stop this from happening is to further involve the community and frequently update them on things that are going on. On the other hand the community needs to chill with everything, because to me it seems like we complain that nothing gets done, then when someone actually decides to do something we continue complaining. I have to admit that to the community there are some staff members that seem/are biased as well as power hungry, I really don't think that is ever good to have in a team and some things need to be done to resolve this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all honesty I think that everyone needs to chill and actually work together to get things done.

If Avicus is going to change, it needs to be done now and it needs to be done quick. Staff bias seems to be a problem. I am not 100% certain as to what the situation is as I have not been a member of staff myself but I have talked to lots of staff so I do know quite a fair amount to the situation (although I have just returned after a week of vacation, so I don't know much about the more recent problems in detail). The main problem about the bias is not the bias itself, but fixing it. From what I see, a fair amount of people try to fix it with good points, but nothing happens. Change needs to happen, \u0026nbsp;Change also needs to be established well, it's no use just having the staff making the changes-just like it's no use having just the community bring them out. We need to work together. Sitting around screaming for change brings attention to the matter, but nothing ever happens. In fact, screaming at the staff loosens the bond between staff and community. Instead, people need to stop shouting and get together again. This post will probably have some useful criticism which is much needed, but I can assure you that there will also be a mug comment .-. As to how we get together again, just stop shouting and see what happens. Being too over friendly with players is quite frankly\u0026nbsp;creepy, and not doing anything is ignoring the matter. Acknowledging players presence when they talk is a step forward, especially when dealing with reports as a lot of the time staff get distracted.
