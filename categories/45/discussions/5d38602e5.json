These…things…are\r\ngoing to destroy Minecraftia.” Apple looked up from his throne. “There is only\r\none way we can stop this.” he said loud and clear. “It is time for Avicus and\r\nOvercast to put our differences aside and join together.” The two men stood up.\r\n“Meet me at Hub01 on Avicus.” stated the leader of Avicus. Apple hesitated. “Very\r\nwell.” he said after what seemed like eternity. After that, the two Leaders\r\nwalked off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 1\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \"What the?!\" yelled Porky, a well known regular. \"I was just about to finish breaking my one\u0026nbsp;hundredth monument today!\" Thousands of murmurs broke out through the crowd of regulars. \"Regulars of Avicus. I have teleported you all here for a very important declaration!\" a voice yelled above the murmurs. Everyone looked up. \"Ivy!?\" everyone screamed in unison. The loudest cheers ever broke out. \"I know I haven't been here for awhile. But this is really important.\" the leader began.\u0026nbsp;\"I have met with the leader of Overcast. We are declaring war on the Butter Alliance!\" Everyone stopped cheering. The last time Avicus had a war was with the people they were now allying with. Overcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 2\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \"It's a trick!\" yelled an unknown voice in the crowd. Everyone looked at where the voice cam from. \"Who is\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003ethat\u003c/i\u003e?!\" yelled a regular. Suddenly, Ivy gasped. He opened his mouth to say something, but he was cut off by an extremely loud explosion.\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eKABOBMMJDJFJHSJDK!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e Bodies went flying all over the place. Fires broke out and people yelled for help. \"Who was that?!\" Badger yelled. All eyes stared up at Ivy, waiting for an answer. But the look on his face showed it was something very, very bad. After awhile, the Leader finally said the words \"He's back.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 3\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"I want three patrols at the border to the Butter Alliance, NOW!\" the Leader shouted fiercely. If the person he had seen was who he thought it was, his people were in grave danger. \"But the person who did...that...had a cloak on so none of us know what he looks like!\" Milk called to Ivy. Ivy couldn't just tell the people who it was...they'd be horrified! The Leader thought for a moment, searching deeply for the right words. \"People of Avicus, it seems that a man who was banished many years ago, has come back.\" he said, sounding a little nervous. The crowd gasped so loudly it would've woken the laziest cat in the world. Then, they all drew their bows, swords, daggers, you name it, and began forming the three patrols. \"Who is this person?\" a regular named Robin asked. All eyes darkened at the question. \"Tigerman.\" Ivy said silently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 4\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy traveled across his beautiful land over to Hub01, a medium sized castle. When he walked in, he saw Apple waiting in the center of the castle eating golden apples. \"Hello, Ivy.\" Apple called. The Leaders talked together for a little while. \"What are the plans?\" Ivy asked. Apple's eyes seemed to suddenly brighten up. \"Well, I was thinking we could gather our best warriors and charge all of the Butter Alliances castles. We can easily defeat those stinky budder-obsessed suckers!\" he said quite happy with his idea. \"Well, how do we know where their bases are? And what if they have more warriors than us?\" he asked. Apple thought for a moment. \"We could send out spies. Make them look like they hated Avicus and Overcast and wanted to help Butter Alliance destroy us.\" he announced his plan proudly. \"Good idea, Apple. I'll send my spies out tomorrow at dawn.\" Ivy said, finishing the conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 5\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; As Ivy walked over to his Palace, he was greeted by Sethskye, one of the kingdom's best soldiers. \"Hello, we sent the three patrols you wanted. They all came back safely. Ducky said she'll inform you on what they saw.\" Ivy thanked Sethskye and waked over to the patrol, who were silently waiting by the largest tower. They all waved their hands in greeting to their leader. \"Sethskye told me you guys could tell me about the patrol.\" Ivy said, ready for Ducky to say they had slayed Tigerman. Sadly, that wasn't what he got at all. As she explained what they had seen, Ivy wondered where his enemy could be right now. Suddenly, he heard a sentence that chilled his bones. \"\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003eWe suddenly got ambushed by a bunch of freaks in gold robes who ended up taking one of the patrols hostage.\" Ducky finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 6\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy quickly ran to the Grand Armory and took his magic sword made from the strongest rubies in Minecraftia. The citizens watched as their leader suited up, ready to battle anyone or anything that came in his way. \"How many people from the Butter Alliance were in the ambush?\" he asked quickly. Ducky thought for a moment then finally said \"Probably around twenty-five.\" The Leader began tossing swords, bows, chestplates, and all sorts of things into the crowd of people. \"Everyone get ready to attack.\" Ivy said loud and clear. He looked over to his left and suddenly remembered that he had to send spies! \"Wait!\" he shouted loud enough to kill the excited murmurs. \"I would like to see Sethskye, Badger, Porky, Sevo, and Snow at the second gate. I've some words to share.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 7\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \"No way!\" the five warriors said in unison. \"This is gonna be awesome!\" said Snow. Ivy hushed the excited bunch by raising his hand. He looked at each of the warriors. \"This is a very important mission. You five are people who hate how Avicus has treated you. You are going over to the Butter Alliance to seek revenge on the kingdom that sabotaged your life.\" The leader explained to his citizens. He went ahead and gave some more information on what they would be searching for, how they would escape, and that there were spies from Overcast doing the same thing. \"You five will be known as Squad 1017.\" he finished off, giving the team their official name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 8\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAs the group walked out of the heavily guarded entrance, they thought up a plan. They needed a leader, first of all. In less than a minute, they all decided Snow would be the best leader due to his intelligence and trustworthiness. \"I'll lead you all into battle. We'll do anything we can to make sure Avicus and Overcast stay alive. And we will succeed!\" Snow declared. The members of the group cheered in happiness. Approximately fifteen minutes later, Squad 1017 arrived at the meeting place. There was no sign of any Overcast soldiers. Squad 1017 waited for twenty more minutes when they concluded that the Overcast squad wasn't coming. As they began to walk towards the other border, the one with the Budder Alliance, a arrow flew past their heads and smacked a tree. They were being ambushed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 9\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; People in dark cloaks sprinted through the trees making it extremely hard to see them. Squad 1017 drew their weapons and made a defensive circle. Suddenly, Badger shot an ice arrow that hit one of the cloaked attackers in the face. The man made an awful screech as his face began to be layered with thick ice which soon made him collapse. The other mysterious people made ear splitting howls and seemed to float off into the distance as if they were ghosts. The squad walked over to the one body that they had managed to kill. As Porky turned it over, he noticed that the eyes of the person were glowing amber. \"What the heck is this thing?\" he said, puzzled. Nobody in the squad knew what it was, but it definitely wasn't a regular human. \"It's an Ay'lumow,\" a new voice answered. \"They were ancient ghost-like beings that griefed all sorts of human villages, kingdoms, and much more.\" As the group turned around with their weapons still drawn, they realized the speaker was an Overcast soldier. Two men stood to his right and one man to his left. The group had arrived. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 10\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy watched as his fellow warriors trained harder than ever for the upcoming war. Robin was slashing at a couple dummies with his iron sword. Peachy and Zeusy were having an intense duel with wooden swords and potions. \"These guys are strong. We'll win this war alongside the help of our allies, and we will rid the world of Minecraftia of all its evil. Peace will be restored once and for all!\" Ivy declared. The crowd of warriors gathered around and called out loud and proud. \"I've thought up a plan, my warriors!\" Ivy began once more. \"We will set up traps at the border of our land to make sure we are safe. I will hire more blacksmiths and chemists to make us powerful weapons and potions! We will go to battle in exactly one day from now.\" The people gave excited battle cries as they prepared for the first battle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 11\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Let the countdown begin!\" Ivy called. Tick...tick...tick...tick...tick...BING! The practice match had began. Ivy had been training himself and his warriors all day, preparing for the ambush that would take place in aproximately 12 hours. The practice field was a replica of a battlefield called \"Venomous.\" Vines littered the area along with long grass and flowers. Each team had three monuments which were a source of power that all the kingdoms had. It contained all the power of the army. If all of them were destroyed, the army would have no chance of winning. Looking closely from his tower, Kylo spotted a rusher from Lime team running along the walls placing blocks like a madman. The fellow member's name was Spartemex, one of the nicest warriors out there. Right as Spartemex began building over to the opponent's left monument, he was blasted off his bridge from a swift wooden arrow. Emmaye was a very experienced fighter who a lot of people looked up to. Some apprentices even had skirmishes over who could duel him during practice. As Ivy's eyes drifted off of Emmaye, he saw Porky climb up a hill and dive at his opponent, nailing him right in the middle of the chest with his wooden practice sword. After many surprising moments, the match finally came to an end with Cyan team picking up the win, 2-3. These were some experienced warriors, but there weren't many. \"The Butter Alliance may have many more fighters than us...but they don't have brains.\" Ivy thought to himself, feeling happy about how skilled his warriors were becoming. He would enjoy fighting alongside them till the very end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 12\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"You the kids from Avicus?\" Martin asked. Seth stepped up. \"Yeah. I guess you're the cowards who watch others be circled by a bunch of ugly ass ghost people. Correct?\" Seth said powerfully. Martin stared. \"Look man, we-\" before he could finish, a fist flashed out and bashed Seth straight in the face. All Hell broke loose as the two groups began beating each other. \"Calm the fuck down!\" Sevoh screeched. As the fighting slowly stopped, the two groups got up. \"If our journey is going to continue like this, then we're screwed! We were chosen for a reason!\" He finished. The groups stared at each other, and finally agreed. \"Well, well, well...What do we have here? Spies?\" A childish voice called. Suddenly, a midget covered in shiny yellow armor blasted out of the trees with a golden axe swinging clumsily. Porky ducked a swipe and kicked the midget right in the chest. He fell over, and couldn't get up. After numerous curse words, the warrior attempted to continue fighting, but to no prevail. \"We have no time for this.\" Snow muttered. He swung his axe and sliced the warrior's arm off. \"Oh my God! How could you? You have no idea what I used that arm for!\" The midget screamed in pain. Snow managed to shut him up, and began interrogating him. \"State your name, rank, and allegiance.\" He said calmly. \"Please, you gotta help me! I-I-I'll give you some information about my alliance!\" The midget begged. \"Go on.\" Noel, a member of the OCN squad said. \"O-o-okay...our leader is plotting to-\" his sentence was cutoff as an arrow blasted through his skull, leaving blood all over the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 13\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\"Now!\" Ivy, Zeusy, Frozen, Frosted, and some others ambushed the patrol of Butter Alliance warriors. Legoche was perched in a tree, shooting arrows faster than a cat. Ivy had assigned Steven to backup duty. His job was to run back and bring more warriors if something went wrong. SLASH! Frosted sliced the throat of a warrior wide open and watched as his blood drained from his body. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her arm and turned around to see blood welling from a deep wound. The Butter Alliance soldier prepared to behead her, only to have his hand chopped off like a piece of cheese. Blood spurted everywhere and he cried in pain. Frosted, still bleeding, turned around to the sound of running, to see battalions of warriors pour onto their side of the border. They were losing the battle! \"Steven! We need reinforcements, immediately!\" As Zeusy got Frosted to cover, Steven rocketed off to the kingdom to bring as many warriors as he could. Frozen continued slashing at the hideous, clumsy fighters. She slowly began to get tired, and fell to the floor, out of breath. More gold warriors stampeded the clearing, forcing the Avicus group to fall back, for they were taking heavy casualties. Ivy watched in horror as he saw Frozen get stampeded over by hundreds of feet. \"Legoche, prepare the archers!\" Zeusy called. \"Aye aye, sir!\" Legoche replied. \"Ready! Aim! Fire!\" Around 60 arrows shot into the crowd of enemies. \"The reinforcements have arrived!\" Steven called. As the Avicus forces began to gain more ground, they started pushing the enemy back, then circling them making sure none escaped. Suddenly, Ivy thought of something. \"These forces must have a commander....\" He looked around and spotted one of the most vile men in the world - Bajan. He sprinted towards the ugly man and crashed into his side, knocking him over. He then stabbed Bajan in the abdomen, squirting blood everywhere. Bajan began gurgling and coughing out blood. \"Nooooo!\" The enemy knocked Ivy off of their commander and retreated into the mist with their leader in their arms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 14\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"We need to amputate the arm!\" Raging shouted. Avicus had one the battle, but at a huge cost. They had lost the great warrior Frozen, and Frosted was just about to get her left arm amputated due to a powerful infection. SLICE! SLICE! SLICE! SLICE! Blood poured out of the wound like a waterfall. \"Get Iz over here!\" Raging called to Peachy. Iz performed a spell that stopped the bleeding. As they cleaned up the wound, Frosted had woken. \"W-where's my forearm?\" Frosted asked drowsily. Iz explained how she had been injured during battle and how they had to amputate her forearm. \"How am I suppose to fight now?\" She asked, sadness in her eyes. \"I think I could help.\" Cole said. \"I could give you a replacement arm...or better.\" Frosted thought for awhile, and then finally, she spoke. \"What do you mean, \"or better?\"\"\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 15\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Dang, this...is great!\" Frosted said. She swung her new arm around. \"I must say, I'm impressed. I've always wanted a sword for an arm!\" Ivy went back to his work after seeing Cole's surgery was a complete success. He was one of the most talented person in the kingdom. \"Let all people of Avicus gather beneath the throne for a meeting!\" Ivy called to his people. As they gathered around, he explained his plan. They would attack the guards who protected the Temple of Butter. It wa she heavily protected, but Ivy believed his fighters could pull it off. Destroying the temple would also send a message to Sky, showing that they would fight till the end. There will be 4 patrols. 3 will attack and 1 will watch over and support whichever group needs assistance. All in favor of the plan, raise your swords.\" All the swords in the clearing were raised. \"Very well. We attack at midnight. Oh, and I forgot to mention. We've got some help from Overcast, and another new ally, Badlion. We will meet up at the Overcast border, and attack the near the center of Hypixel which is where the Temple is located. We shall fight till the end, my people!\" Ivy finished off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 16\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Looks like the lady's finally awake!\" a loud voice boomed. The prisoner was tied to a chair with an ugly, brown furred beast staring at her. He held a massive battle axe in his right hand made entirely out of gold and diamonds. \"I've got a meeting with my master, lady. Sit tight and enjoy the show!\" the huge beast lit a torch and dropped it a few feet away from the prisoner. As the prisoner looked closely through her blurry vision, she noticed there were sticks of dynamite all over the room. \"I got you a nice long fuse to say good bye to all your friends and family. Not in person, of course. BAHAHAHHAHAHAH!\" the beast blasted. He walked out the exit with a final glance back at the prisoner. \"Good-bye, princess.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 17\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Alright, guys. This is going to be our first major victory. I'm sure of it.\" Ivy spoke to his troops as they prepared to jump out of the undergrowth and smash the Temple. \"Peachy, Petlas Spookeh, spread your soldiers around the back of the building. My troops will give support while Venomous's group will charge inside the temple.\" After what seemed like eternity, the troops burst through the undergrowth and got into formation. Petlas swiped a slender guard covered in gold across the face, blinding him. She then gave a heavy blow to his neck, decapitating him. Spookeh was a quick fighter and was very skilled at fighting multiple opponents. He slide under a guards legs, cutting his groin as he went along. \"Ahhhhhhhh!\" the warrior let out an agonizing screech and toppled to the floor, bleeding profusely. As Spookeh got back up to his feet, he looked back to see a massive long furred beast tossing warriors as if they were rag dolls. \"Holy shit!\" he yelped. \"Ivy! What the heck is that? It's hideous!\" Not happy with the insult, the beast let out a roar. \"Avicus scumbags!\" he grabbed the warrior and tossed him into the temple. As he walked towards an injured Spookeh, he grabbed an Avicus warrior and snapped back with his knee. Within seconds, he stood in front of Spookeh with his axe in both hands. \"How does it feel going one on one with Jerome himself?\" he snarled, raising his axe for the final blow that would smash the skull of the young warrior. Suddenly, a volley of arrows smashed into Jerome's back. He dropped his axe, turned around, and then proceeded to flee towards a palace with blood streaming behind him. \"We're losing are ground! We must retreat!\" Ivy called to his fighters. Spookeh yelled back in surprise, \"Why?! We can win this!\" Ivy stared at the young warrior. \"This was not our battle to win. We must live to fight another day, apprentice.\" Reluctantly, Spookeh retreated with his people back to their land.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 18\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \"My group and I revised a plan on our way over here,\" Martin began. \"We go deep into Mineplex territory, and we don't attack. We drop our weapons and tell them we're rebelling against our homes. Sound good?\" Everyone agreed and moved on through the woods. It had taken awhile for Squad 1017 and Squad 3102, the name of the Overcast squad, to get along, but it happened. They walked together in a group moving as fast as they could towards the center of Mineplex. It wasn't going to be a quick journey. In fact, it may take a few days. \"It seems we're traveling into land that belongs to some natives called the Mokorahee. They're cannibals and are really...merciless.\" Cubist, one of the Overcast members, informed. The information did a nice job at making the spies nervous. \"Ecifircas! Ecifircas!\" a chant began to grow louder and louder as the group moved on. \"The natives! They're here!\" Seth exclaimed. The spies drew their weapons and got into a circle formation to fend off enemies from all directions. Black tattooed natives blasted out of hiding and dove at the spies slashing with weapons like knives, daggers, spears, and tomahawks. Some were even using their bare hands! The group slashed as fast as they could, but it just wasn't enough. The natives were smashing through their shields and armor, pushing the spies into a tighter circle to make attacking more difficult. \"Attack!\" a battle call echoed around the area as men that were covered in gold plating began to attack the Mokorahee warriors from behind. The rest of the tattooed cannibals ran back into the woods, covered in cuts. The leader of the rescuers turned his head around and asked, \"Who the hell are you?\" Squad 1017 and Squad 3102 dropped their weapons and explained their fake story. \"We are tired of how our homes, Avicus and Overcast, have treated us. They have no idea of our potential and talk to us as if we are children. We have journeyed to become a part of your kingdom and destroy the servers that neglected us!\" Snow lied. The leader of the golden armored fighters chuckled. \"Looks like we got some more followers. The name's Deadlox.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 19\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy lay in his bed, breathing in the sweet scent of the infirmary as Atdit bandaged a gash on his arm. The events of the failed mission to destroy the Temple flashed through Ivy's head. Half the squad had been killed while the other half were badly injured. As Atdit finished tending to Ivy's wound, he moved on to the next patient. Ivy sat up slowly, his neck aching from the battle. He looked over his shoulder and in the bed right next to his, he saw the young warrior Spookeh. His chest was covered in bandages that were blotched with blood. \"Hey, Spookeh,\" Ivy called to the warrior. The warrior didn't move a bit. \"Spookeh?\" Ivy asked, a hint of fear in his voice. \"He's recovering from critical injuries, sir.\" Ivy turned around to see ParaSpider approach him. Para was a loyal warrior, and would never stop referring to Ivy as \"sir.\" Para explained how Spookeh had passed out once he entered the castle, and after close examination, bruises were all over his back. He had also broken a few ribs. Ivy soon left the infirmary and called Peachy and Zeusy in for a meeting. \"Been awhile since we've had a say in decisions, eh Ivy?\" Peachy joked around. Although it was obvious Peachy was just messing around, Ivy realized that what seemed to be a joke was actually true. Once all three men were seated, Ivy began. \"We're leading an assault on one of the major castles. Jerome's, to be exact.\" Ivy explained. \"What do you guys think?\" \u0026nbsp;Peachy and Zeusy thought for a minute, and then spoke. \"Don't you think it's too soon to be attacking such well protected places?\" Zeusy asked, with Peachy giving a nod of agreement. \"I somewhat agree, although it would give us a massive chunk of ground where we could set camps. And if we're lucky, we capture Jerome.\" After around one more hour of discussion, it was settled. \u0026nbsp;Ivy knew as a fact that this battle would be victorious. But he had thought the same with the last...and that hadn't ended so well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 20\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; The spies followed Deadlox and his soldiers through the gateway that lead into the heart of the palace. Two guards with beautifully designed gold armor prepared their weapons as the spies came in. \"Easy, fellas. They're with me.\" Deadlox eased the men. The walk to Deadlox's quarters was quiet, until Badger spoke. \"What is the reason your men fight for?\" Deadlox kept walking and then casually said, \"They don't believe in being together. All the kingdoms could be combined into one major kingdom. We would be rich and powerful and we'd help each other out. We are growing. Every day. Every hour. Every minute. Every second. Under the leadership of Sky, we never have to worry.\" Deadlox entered his quarters and invited the spies in. \"Would any of you like a drink?\" He asked. \"No tha-\" Badger was cut off as Seth jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow. \"Sure thing, Deadlox.\" The spies stared at the man as he stared back blankly. \"You do not address me by my name. You will refer to me as Your Majesty, Your Highness, or Your Excellency.\" He said sternly, a hit of anger in his voice. After that, they all sat down in antique gold chairs. \"This is some of the finest wine in my kingdom. I don't let many people have its, but you all are an exception.\" Deadlox took a gulp of wine. He then adjusted his chair so he could see the view from his quarters. While he wasn't looking, the spies quickly spilled their drinks onto behind their chairs. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. That was indeed some very nice wine.\" Martin praised. Suddenly, the glass in Deadlox's had crush from the power of his grip. \"There is no need to lie, my friend.\" He said through clenched teeth. He then walked out his door, dismissing the group.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 21\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eIvy had brought around 200 of his greatest soldiers with him to invade Jerome's palace. It was not going to be an easy mission, but through hard fighting, Ivy knew they could win the battle. \"Emmaye, are the portable TNT cannons ready? Ivy asked Emmaye, who had been put in charge of the cannons. \"Yes, we've got 12 Basics,1 Icarus, and 3 Whiskys.\" Emmaye reported. \"Good. Lego, are the archers in position?\" The leader called to the lead archer. \"Yes. We've got 5 groups of 9 surrounding the castle. \"Ducky, are those horsemen ready?\" Ivy asked the leader of the horsemen. \"Yep! The horses are hungry for action.\" She said excitedly. \"Glitchy, are those swordsman ready?\" Ivy called to one of his best soldiers. \"Yes, Captain!\" Glitchy stated loud and clear. Ivy raised his sword, and gave a battle cry. All the troops spilled into the flat land where the castle was built. \"Get those Basics over here!\" Ivy called to Emmaye. The enemy was preparing to fight back, but they were clumsy. Chickens began spilling out of the gateway and into the ponds. \"Maybe this'll be easier than we thought!\" Emmaye said. \"Basics, fire in 3! 2! 1! Now!\" BOOOOOM! A dozen balls of TNT smashed into the wall of the castle, creating a massive crater. \"I want 2 groups in that Jcarus now! We're aiming for the top of the wall. Take out those archers.! Emmaye commanded. Meanwhile, Ducky's horsemen had entered through a smaller crater next to the gateway. \"Let's go, Cookiedough!\" Ducky's said to her spotted steed. Horses began running by the heavier enemies and ramming them with their spears and maces. Some others shot bursts of lighting from their hands, roasting the gold plated fools. \"Archers! Aim for the fighters that are coming from the gate! The more we kill, the more we make Ivy's job easier!\" Arrows whistled through the air, some whiffing and some thumping into chests and skulls. Numerous volleys were shot as reinforcements continued to burst out of the gate. \"Split up into groups of 8! Protect the less experienced fighters!\" Glitchy ordered his soldiers. The enemy quickly retreated into the heart of the castle. \"Keep moving! Ivy said. \"Get some more soldiers up and over the walls.\" Avicadians rusher into the castle, continuing to fight as hard as they could. Suddenly, a vicious roar \u0026nbsp;echoed sounded from the top of the castle. \"Fools!\" A massive brown furred beast jumped down and began smashing the Basics. \"We're losing cannons! We need backup, Ivy!\" Emmaye called to his leader. \"How dare you attempt to destroy the home of Jerome?!\" The beast howled, he picked up a soldier and smashed his back down onto his knee, killing him swiftly. As he destroyed most of the Basics, the Icarus, and all of the Whishkys, he began to run towards Ivy. Ivy dived at him with his red sword ready to pierce through Jerome's heart. But he was too quick. He smashed Ivy to the ground and kicked him into the mess hall where the fighting was minimum. He raised his axe to deliver the killing blow, only to be interrupted by a blast of ice which smashed into his back. \"Uhhh!\" Jerome groaned as he fell to his knees. He turned around to see the blue eyes of the prisoner he had found on the battlefield. \"Frozen?\" Ivy couldn't believe his eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 22 (New)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Frozen began pacing towards Jerome, his eyes flaring in rage and confusion. \"You're suppose to be dead! What ARE you?!\" He growled. Right at that moment, the events that took place during Frozen's escape flashed through her mind. She was sitting in a chair with a rope tied around her and a pile of dynamite was getting ready to explode. Suddenly, a few minutes after Jerome had left the bunker, a golden armored warrior entered the room and stopped towards her. \"You killed my brother on the battlefield, and I'll enjoy killing you myself!\" He howled. He swung a golden dagger at Frozen, but she was quick. She stood up and spun around making the warrior's blade slice the rope that tied her to the chair. The warrior swung again, this time catching her arm. She fell onto the hard, obsidian floor and looked up as the man raised his blade for the final kill. Without thinking, Frozen swung her hands up and created a thick, light blue shield of ice. Crack! The dagger had been stuck inside the shield. Taking advantage, Frozen kicked the soldier away, managed to rip the dagger out of the shield and prepare to kill the assassin. Suddenly, She looked to her right and saw the fuse was nearly at the end. She turned around ready to flee, only to be attacked from behind by the guard. \"If I die, then you're coming with me!\" He shouted, anger clouding his mind. Frozen took the dagger and smashed the killer's neck with it, creating a huge gash. Blood shot out of his wound and he flopped onto the floor, heaving. She sprinted as fast as she could towards the gate and made it just in time to the outside. BOOM! Without looking back, Frozen fled into the forest, only caring about getting revenge on that mangy brown furred son of a bitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 23 (New)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Porky looked out his window, admiring the beautiful rolling hills and bright green trees. Interrupting his peace, he heard faint yelling from the trees and saw two Butter warriors running towards the kingdom, exhausted. \"Oh, great,\" he muttered. \"Time to call the others.\" Porky called the spies over and pointed out the mysterious runners. \"Strange.\" Snow said, studying the two clumsy men. \"Must have been attacked by robins.\" The group laughed and went back to their bunk beds. \"Newcomers! Go check out what those hooligans want!\" Deadlox commanded from his throne. Swiftly, he spies got dressed and ran outside to intercept the guards. \"What do you need?\" Martin asked one of the warriors. \"Mas...ter...Jerome...is being...attacked...we..need..reinforce...ments!\" The scout finished. \"Attacked?\" Snow said, suddenly realizing his friends and family back at home must have lead the assault. \"Please...let us speak...to Deadlox!\" The other thin scout gasped for air. The spies looked at each. \"Deadlox will not be able to assist you at this time. He is currently leading an assault on...uh...um....\" Badger tried to think up a convincing lie, only to be saved by Noel. \"Badlion. He took millions of soldiers with him.\" The scouts eyes widened. \"That isn't true! Deadlox always sends a letter to all members of the Butter Alliance! Youre liars!\" The scouts attempted to flee, but were quickly stopped by Buck. \"How about we make a deal? We give you 10,000 credits each to turn around and go back to that hairy animal.\" The scouts backed away. \"No! Why should we have to-\" he was stopped when Noel raised the tip of his sword to the scout's neck. \"Go.\" He exclaimed. The scouts ran off, tripping and crawling back to their kingdom.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 24 (Newest)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; As Frozen's flashback came to an end, all she could think about was slaying Jerome. Using her magic to create a compact ice shield and sword, she prepared to charge towards the massive brown beast, but he was ready. He flashed out an arm, sending Frozen flying across the room. He brought out his battle axe, and got into fighting position. Anger and determination kept Frozen moving as she dodged and sliced at Jerome. She had never fought this hard in her life, but her anger seemed to control her. Jerome swung his axe at her legs, and she hopped over. He went for a kick with his left leg, only to have an icy blade slice it open. \"Gahh!\" He screeched as blood began pouring out of his wound, all over the golden tile floor. \"You will die where you stand!\" Raising his axe, he threw it skillfully. Frozen attempted to dodge it, but it wasn't a complete success. She moved to the side to stop her skull from being smashed to bits, but it instead crashed into her shoulder, severely injuring her. \"Did that actually work?\" Jerome said, surprised. \"That's the first time it's ever connected!\" He began pacing towards Frozen, ready to deal the killing blow. As he grabbed her by the neck, he began tightening his grip to snap her neck. Suddenly, as she began fading, she noticed the palace was burning. Flames were everywhere and chunks of wood were falling from the ceiling. \"You destroy my home, I destroy your life!\" Jerome tightened his fist so quick that Frozen passed out, and she could hear her neck cracking a little. Soon, she gave up her struggling and let defeat take over. Slice! Jerome's grip lessened and Frozen fell to the floor, her eyes glazed, she could barely see what was going on, but what she knew was that Ivy had attacked the beast.\"Ivy! We must retreat! The palace is burning to ashes and we've practically killed everyone.\" Emmaye informed Ivy of their victory. \"Alright, help me bring her back to the kingdom.\" Ivy replied. As all the Avicus warriors spilled outside the burning castle, \u0026nbsp;and Ivy and Emmaye were at the back of the mob. All the fighters got out except a few Randy class troopers, Emmaye, Ivy, and Frozen who was still passed out. A massive body crashed in front of the remaining troopers and began killing them with ease. The Warriors who had already escaped attempted to assist, but were blocked off by a massive chunk of flaming wood. All the Randies that had been left in the castle were dead, so it was just Emmaye and Ivy left to kill the beast.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e[--To be continued.

The loudest cheers ever broke out. \"I know I haven't been here for awhile. But this is really important.\" the leader began.\u0026nbsp;\"I have met with the leader of Overcast.

After awhile, the Leader finally said the words \"He's back.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 3\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"I want three patrols at the border to the Butter Alliance, NOW!\" the Leader shouted fiercely. If the person he had seen was who he thought it was, his people were in grave danger. \"But the person who did...that...had a cloak on so none of us know what he looks like!\" Milk called to Ivy. Ivy couldn't just tell the people who it was...they'd be horrified! The Leader thought for a moment, searching deeply for the right words. \"People of Avicus, it seems that a man who was banished many years ago, has come back.\" he said, sounding a little nervous. The crowd gasped so loudly it would've woken the laziest cat in the world. Then, they all drew their bows, swords, daggers, you name it, and began forming the three patrols. \"Who is this person?\" a regular named Robin asked. All eyes darkened at the question. \"Tigerman.\" Ivy said silently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 4\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy traveled across his beautiful land over to Hub01, a medium sized castle. When he walked in, he saw Apple waiting in the center of the castle eating golden apples. \"Hello, Ivy.\" Apple called. The Leaders talked together for a little while. \"What are the plans?\" Ivy asked. Apple's eyes seemed to suddenly brighten up. \"Well, I was thinking we could gather our best warriors and charge all of the Butter Alliances castles. We can easily defeat those stinky budder-obsessed suckers!\" he said quite happy with his idea. \"Well, how do we know where their bases are? And what if they have more warriors than us?\" he asked. Apple thought for a moment. \"We could send out spies. Make them look like they hated Avicus and Overcast and wanted to help Butter Alliance destroy us.\" he announced his plan proudly. \"Good idea, Apple. I'll send my spies out tomorrow at dawn.\" Ivy said, finishing the conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 5\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; As Ivy walked over to his Palace, he was greeted by Sethskye, one of the kingdom's best soldiers. \"Hello, we sent the three patrols you wanted. They all came back safely. Ducky said she'll inform you on what they saw.\" Ivy thanked Sethskye and waked over to the patrol, who were silently waiting by the largest tower. They all waved their hands in greeting to their leader. \"Sethskye told me you guys could tell me about the patrol.\" Ivy said, ready for Ducky to say they had slayed Tigerman. Sadly, that wasn't what he got at all. As she explained what they had seen, Ivy wondered where his enemy could be right now. Suddenly, he heard a sentence that chilled his bones. \"\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003eWe suddenly got ambushed by a bunch of freaks in gold robes who ended up taking one of the patrols hostage.\" Ducky finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 6\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy quickly ran to the Grand Armory and took his magic sword made from the strongest rubies in Minecraftia. The citizens watched as their leader suited up, ready to battle anyone or anything that came in his way. \"How many people from the Butter Alliance were in the ambush?\" he asked quickly. Ducky thought for a moment then finally said \"Probably around twenty-five.\" The Leader began tossing swords, bows, chestplates, and all sorts of things into the crowd of people. \"Everyone get ready to attack.\" Ivy said loud and clear. He looked over to his left and suddenly remembered that he had to send spies! \"Wait!\" he shouted loud enough to kill the excited murmurs. \"I would like to see Sethskye, Badger, Porky, Sevo, and Snow at the second gate. I've some words to share.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 7\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \"No way!\" the five warriors said in unison. \"This is gonna be awesome!\" said Snow. Ivy hushed the excited bunch by raising his hand. He looked at each of the warriors. \"This is a very important mission. You five are people who hate how Avicus has treated you. You are going over to the Butter Alliance to seek revenge on the kingdom that sabotaged your life.\" The leader explained to his citizens. He went ahead and gave some more information on what they would be searching for, how they would escape, and that there were spies from Overcast doing the same thing. \"You five will be known as Squad 1017.\" he finished off, giving the team their official name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 8\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAs the group walked out of the heavily guarded entrance, they thought up a plan.

We'll do anything we can to make sure Avicus and Overcast stay alive. And we will succeed!\" Snow declared. The members of the group cheered in happiness. Approximately fifteen minutes later, Squad 1017 arrived at the meeting place. There was no sign of any Overcast soldiers. Squad 1017 waited for twenty more minutes when they concluded that the Overcast squad wasn't coming. As they began to walk towards the other border, the one with the Budder Alliance, a arrow flew past their heads and smacked a tree. They were being ambushed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 9\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; People in dark cloaks sprinted through the trees making it extremely hard to see them. Squad 1017 drew their weapons and made a defensive circle. Suddenly, Badger shot an ice arrow that hit one of the cloaked attackers in the face. The man made an awful screech as his face began to be layered with thick ice which soon made him collapse. The other mysterious people made ear splitting howls and seemed to float off into the distance as if they were ghosts. The squad walked over to the one body that they had managed to kill. As Porky turned it over, he noticed that the eyes of the person were glowing amber. \"What the heck is this thing?\" he said, puzzled. Nobody in the squad knew what it was, but it definitely wasn't a regular human. \"It's an Ay'lumow,\" a new voice answered. \"They were ancient ghost-like beings that griefed all sorts of human villages, kingdoms, and much more.\" As the group turned around with their weapons still drawn, they realized the speaker was an Overcast soldier. Two men stood to his right and one man to his left. The group had arrived. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 10\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy watched as his fellow warriors trained harder than ever for the upcoming war. Robin was slashing at a couple dummies with his iron sword. Peachy and Zeusy were having an intense duel with wooden swords and potions. \"These guys are strong. We'll win this war alongside the help of our allies, and we will rid the world of Minecraftia of all its evil. Peace will be restored once and for all!\" Ivy declared. The crowd of warriors gathered around and called out loud and proud. \"I've thought up a plan, my warriors!\" Ivy began once more. \"We will set up traps at the border of our land to make sure we are safe. I will hire more blacksmiths and chemists to make us powerful weapons and potions! We will go to battle in exactly one day from now.\" The people gave excited battle cries as they prepared for the first battle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 11\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Let the countdown begin!\" Ivy called. Tick...tick...tick...tick...tick...BING! The practice match had began. Ivy had been training himself and his warriors all day, preparing for the ambush that would take place in aproximately 12 hours. The practice field was a replica of a battlefield called \"Venomous.\" Vines littered the area along with long grass and flowers. Each team had three monuments which were a source of power that all the kingdoms had. It contained all the power of the army. If all of them were destroyed, the army would have no chance of winning. Looking closely from his tower, Kylo spotted a rusher from Lime team running along the walls placing blocks like a madman. The fellow member's name was Spartemex, one of the nicest warriors out there. Right as Spartemex began building over to the opponent's left monument, he was blasted off his bridge from a swift wooden arrow. Emmaye was a very experienced fighter who a lot of people looked up to. Some apprentices even had skirmishes over who could duel him during practice. As Ivy's eyes drifted off of Emmaye, he saw Porky climb up a hill and dive at his opponent, nailing him right in the middle of the chest with his wooden practice sword. After many surprising moments, the match finally came to an end with Cyan team picking up the win, 2-3. These were some experienced warriors, but there weren't many. \"The Butter Alliance may have many more fighters than us...but they don't have brains.\" Ivy thought to himself, feeling happy about how skilled his warriors were becoming. He would enjoy fighting alongside them till the very end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 12\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"You the kids from Avicus?\" Martin asked. Seth stepped up. \"Yeah. I guess you're the cowards who watch others be circled by a bunch of ugly ass ghost people. Correct?\" Seth said powerfully. Martin stared. \"Look man, we-\" before he could finish, a fist flashed out and bashed Seth straight in the face. All Hell broke loose as the two groups began beating each other. \"Calm the fuck down!\" Sevoh screeched. As the fighting slowly stopped, the two groups got up. \"If our journey is going to continue like this, then we're screwed! We were chosen for a reason!\" He finished. The groups stared at each other, and finally agreed. \"Well, well, well...What do we have here? Spies?\" A childish voice called. Suddenly, a midget covered in shiny yellow armor blasted out of the trees with a golden axe swinging clumsily. Porky ducked a swipe and kicked the midget right in the chest. He fell over, and couldn't get up. After numerous curse words, the warrior attempted to continue fighting, but to no prevail. \"We have no time for this.\" Snow muttered. He swung his axe and sliced the warrior's arm off. \"Oh my God! How could you? You have no idea what I used that arm for!\" The midget screamed in pain. Snow managed to shut him up, and began interrogating him. \"State your name, rank, and allegiance.\" He said calmly. \"Please, you gotta help me! I-I-I'll give you some information about my alliance!\" The midget begged. \"Go on.\" Noel, a member of the OCN squad said. \"O-o-okay...our leader is plotting to-\" his sentence was cutoff as an arrow blasted through his skull, leaving blood all over the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 13\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\"Now!\" Ivy, Zeusy, Frozen, Frosted, and some others ambushed the patrol of Butter Alliance warriors. Legoche was perched in a tree, shooting arrows faster than a cat. Ivy had assigned Steven to backup duty. His job was to run back and bring more warriors if something went wrong. SLASH! Frosted sliced the throat of a warrior wide open and watched as his blood drained from his body. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her arm and turned around to see blood welling from a deep wound. The Butter Alliance soldier prepared to behead her, only to have his hand chopped off like a piece of cheese. Blood spurted everywhere and he cried in pain. Frosted, still bleeding, turned around to the sound of running, to see battalions of warriors pour onto their side of the border. They were losing the battle! \"Steven! We need reinforcements, immediately!\" As Zeusy got Frosted to cover, Steven rocketed off to the kingdom to bring as many warriors as he could. Frozen continued slashing at the hideous, clumsy fighters. She slowly began to get tired, and fell to the floor, out of breath. More gold warriors stampeded the clearing, forcing the Avicus group to fall back, for they were taking heavy casualties. Ivy watched in horror as he saw Frozen get stampeded over by hundreds of feet. \"Legoche, prepare the archers!\" Zeusy called. \"Aye aye, sir!\" Legoche replied. \"Ready! Aim! Fire!\" Around 60 arrows shot into the crowd of enemies. \"The reinforcements have arrived!\" Steven called. As the Avicus forces began to gain more ground, they started pushing the enemy back, then circling them making sure none escaped. Suddenly, Ivy thought of something. \"These forces must have a commander....\" He looked around and spotted one of the most vile men in the world - Bajan. He sprinted towards the ugly man and crashed into his side, knocking him over. He then stabbed Bajan in the abdomen, squirting blood everywhere. Bajan began gurgling and coughing out blood. \"Nooooo!\" The enemy knocked Ivy off of their commander and retreated into the mist with their leader in their arms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 14\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"We need to amputate the arm!\" Raging shouted. Avicus had one the battle, but at a huge cost. They had lost the great warrior Frozen, and Frosted was just about to get her left arm amputated due to a powerful infection. SLICE! SLICE! SLICE! SLICE! Blood poured out of the wound like a waterfall. \"Get Iz over here!\" Raging called to Peachy. Iz performed a spell that stopped the bleeding. As they cleaned up the wound, Frosted had woken. \"W-where's my forearm?\" Frosted asked drowsily. Iz explained how she had been injured during battle and how they had to amputate her forearm. \"How am I suppose to fight now?\" She asked, sadness in her eyes. \"I think I could help.\" Cole said. \"I could give you a replacement arm...or better.\" Frosted thought for awhile, and then finally, she spoke. \"What do you mean, \"or better?\"\"\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 15\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Dang, this...is great!\" Frosted said. She swung her new arm around. \"I must say, I'm impressed. I've always wanted a sword for an arm!\" Ivy went back to his work after seeing Cole's surgery was a complete success. He was one of the most talented person in the kingdom. \"Let all people of Avicus gather beneath the throne for a meeting!\" Ivy called to his people. As they gathered around, he explained his plan. They would attack the guards who protected the Temple of Butter. It wa she heavily protected, but Ivy believed his fighters could pull it off. Destroying the temple would also send a message to Sky, showing that they would fight till the end. There will be 4 patrols. 3 will attack and 1 will watch over and support whichever group needs assistance. All in favor of the plan, raise your swords.\" All the swords in the clearing were raised. \"Very well. We attack at midnight. Oh, and I forgot to mention. We've got some help from Overcast, and another new ally, Badlion. We will meet up at the Overcast border, and attack the near the center of Hypixel which is where the Temple is located. We shall fight till the end, my people!\" Ivy finished off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 16\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Looks like the lady's finally awake!\" a loud voice boomed. The prisoner was tied to a chair with an ugly, brown furred beast staring at her. He held a massive battle axe in his right hand made entirely out of gold and diamonds. \"I've got a meeting with my master, lady. Sit tight and enjoy the show!\" the huge beast lit a torch and dropped it a few feet away from the prisoner. As the prisoner looked closely through her blurry vision, she noticed there were sticks of dynamite all over the room. \"I got you a nice long fuse to say good bye to all your friends and family. Not in person, of course. BAHAHAHHAHAHAH!\" the beast blasted. He walked out the exit with a final glance back at the prisoner. \"Good-bye, princess.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 17\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\"Alright, guys. This is going to be our first major victory. I'm sure of it.\" Ivy spoke to his troops as they prepared to jump out of the undergrowth and smash the Temple. \"Peachy, Petlas Spookeh, spread your soldiers around the back of the building. My troops will give support while Venomous's group will charge inside the temple.\" After what seemed like eternity, the troops burst through the undergrowth and got into formation. Petlas swiped a slender guard covered in gold across the face, blinding him. She then gave a heavy blow to his neck, decapitating him. Spookeh was a quick fighter and was very skilled at fighting multiple opponents. He slide under a guards legs, cutting his groin as he went along. \"Ahhhhhhhh!\" the warrior let out an agonizing screech and toppled to the floor, bleeding profusely. As Spookeh got back up to his feet, he looked back to see a massive long furred beast tossing warriors as if they were rag dolls. \"Holy shit!\" he yelped. \"Ivy! What the heck is that? It's hideous!\" Not happy with the insult, the beast let out a roar. \"Avicus scumbags!\" he grabbed the warrior and tossed him into the temple. As he walked towards an injured Spookeh, he grabbed an Avicus warrior and snapped back with his knee. Within seconds, he stood in front of Spookeh with his axe in both hands. \"How does it feel going one on one with Jerome himself?\" he snarled, raising his axe for the final blow that would smash the skull of the young warrior. Suddenly, a volley of arrows smashed into Jerome's back. He dropped his axe, turned around, and then proceeded to flee towards a palace with blood streaming behind him. \"We're losing are ground! We must retreat!\" Ivy called to his fighters. Spookeh yelled back in surprise, \"Why?! We can win this!\" Ivy stared at the young warrior. \"This was not our battle to win. We must live to fight another day, apprentice.\" Reluctantly, Spookeh retreated with his people back to their land.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 18\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \"My group and I revised a plan on our way over here,\" Martin began. \"We go deep into Mineplex territory, and we don't attack. We drop our weapons and tell them we're rebelling against our homes. Sound good?\" Everyone agreed and moved on through the woods. It had taken awhile for Squad 1017 and Squad 3102, the name of the Overcast squad, to get along, but it happened. They walked together in a group moving as fast as they could towards the center of Mineplex. It wasn't going to be a quick journey. In fact, it may take a few days. \"It seems we're traveling into land that belongs to some natives called the Mokorahee. They're cannibals and are really...merciless.\" Cubist, one of the Overcast members, informed. The information did a nice job at making the spies nervous. \"Ecifircas! Ecifircas!\" a chant began to grow louder and louder as the group moved on. \"The natives! They're here!\" Seth exclaimed. The spies drew their weapons and got into a circle formation to fend off enemies from all directions. Black tattooed natives blasted out of hiding and dove at the spies slashing with weapons like knives, daggers, spears, and tomahawks. Some were even using their bare hands! The group slashed as fast as they could, but it just wasn't enough. The natives were smashing through their shields and armor, pushing the spies into a tighter circle to make attacking more difficult. \"Attack!\" a battle call echoed around the area as men that were covered in gold plating began to attack the Mokorahee warriors from behind. The rest of the tattooed cannibals ran back into the woods, covered in cuts. The leader of the rescuers turned his head around and asked, \"Who the hell are you?\" Squad 1017 and Squad 3102 dropped their weapons and explained their fake story. \"We are tired of how our homes, Avicus and Overcast, have treated us. They have no idea of our potential and talk to us as if we are children. We have journeyed to become a part of your kingdom and destroy the servers that neglected us!\" Snow lied. The leader of the golden armored fighters chuckled. \"Looks like we got some more followers. The name's Deadlox.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 19\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Ivy lay in his bed, breathing in the sweet scent of the infirmary as Atdit bandaged a gash on his arm. The events of the failed mission to destroy the Temple flashed through Ivy's head. Half the squad had been killed while the other half were badly injured. As Atdit finished tending to Ivy's wound, he moved on to the next patient. Ivy sat up slowly, his neck aching from the battle. He looked over his shoulder and in the bed right next to his, he saw the young warrior Spookeh. His chest was covered in bandages that were blotched with blood. \"Hey, Spookeh,\" Ivy called to the warrior. The warrior didn't move a bit. \"Spookeh?\" Ivy asked, a hint of fear in his voice. \"He's recovering from critical injuries, sir.\" Ivy turned around to see ParaSpider approach him. Para was a loyal warrior, and would never stop referring to Ivy as \"sir.\" Para explained how Spookeh had passed out once he entered the castle, and after close examination, bruises were all over his back. He had also broken a few ribs. Ivy soon left the infirmary and called Peachy and Zeusy in for a meeting. \"Been awhile since we've had a say in decisions, eh Ivy?\" Peachy joked around. Although it was obvious Peachy was just messing around, Ivy realized that what seemed to be a joke was actually true. Once all three men were seated, Ivy began. \"We're leading an assault on one of the major castles. Jerome's, to be exact.\" Ivy explained. \"What do you guys think?\" \u0026nbsp;Peachy and Zeusy thought for a minute, and then spoke. \"Don't you think it's too soon to be attacking such well protected places?\" Zeusy asked, with Peachy giving a nod of agreement. \"I somewhat agree, although it would give us a massive chunk of ground where we could set camps. And if we're lucky, we capture Jerome.\" After around one more hour of discussion, it was settled. \u0026nbsp;Ivy knew as a fact that this battle would be victorious. But he had thought the same with the last...and that hadn't ended so well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 20\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; The spies followed Deadlox and his soldiers through the gateway that lead into the heart of the palace. Two guards with beautifully designed gold armor prepared their weapons as the spies came in. \"Easy, fellas. They're with me.\" Deadlox eased the men. The walk to Deadlox's quarters was quiet, until Badger spoke. \"What is the reason your men fight for?\" Deadlox kept walking and then casually said, \"They don't believe in being together. All the kingdoms could be combined into one major kingdom. We would be rich and powerful and we'd help each other out. We are growing. Every day. Every hour. Every minute. Every second. Under the leadership of Sky, we never have to worry.\" Deadlox entered his quarters and invited the spies in. \"Would any of you like a drink?\" He asked. \"No tha-\" Badger was cut off as Seth jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow. \"Sure thing, Deadlox.\" The spies stared at the man as he stared back blankly. \"You do not address me by my name. You will refer to me as Your Majesty, Your Highness, or Your Excellency.\" He said sternly, a hit of anger in his voice. After that, they all sat down in antique gold chairs. \"This is some of the finest wine in my kingdom. I don't let many people have its, but you all are an exception.\" Deadlox took a gulp of wine. He then adjusted his chair so he could see the view from his quarters. While he wasn't looking, the spies quickly spilled their drinks onto behind their chairs. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. That was indeed some very nice wine.\" Martin praised. Suddenly, the glass in Deadlox's had crush from the power of his grip. \"There is no need to lie, my friend.\" He said through clenched teeth. He then walked out his door, dismissing the group.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 21\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eIvy had brought around 200 of his greatest soldiers with him to invade Jerome's palace. It was not going to be an easy mission, but through hard fighting, Ivy knew they could win the battle. \"Emmaye, are the portable TNT cannons ready? Ivy asked Emmaye, who had been put in charge of the cannons. \"Yes, we've got 12 Basics,1 Icarus, and 3 Whiskys.\" Emmaye reported. \"Good. Lego, are the archers in position?\" The leader called to the lead archer. \"Yes. We've got 5 groups of 9 surrounding the castle. \"Ducky, are those horsemen ready?\" Ivy asked the leader of the horsemen. \"Yep! The horses are hungry for action.\" She said excitedly. \"Glitchy, are those swordsman ready?\" Ivy called to one of his best soldiers. \"Yes, Captain!\" Glitchy stated loud and clear. Ivy raised his sword, and gave a battle cry. All the troops spilled into the flat land where the castle was built. \"Get those Basics over here!\" Ivy called to Emmaye. The enemy was preparing to fight back, but they were clumsy. Chickens began spilling out of the gateway and into the ponds. \"Maybe this'll be easier than we thought!\" Emmaye said. \"Basics, fire in 3! 2! 1! Now!\" BOOOOOM! A dozen balls of TNT smashed into the wall of the castle, creating a massive crater. \"I want 2 groups in that Jcarus now! We're aiming for the top of the wall. Take out those archers.! Emmaye commanded. Meanwhile, Ducky's horsemen had entered through a smaller crater next to the gateway. \"Let's go, Cookiedough!\" Ducky's said to her spotted steed. Horses began running by the heavier enemies and ramming them with their spears and maces. Some others shot bursts of lighting from their hands, roasting the gold plated fools. \"Archers! Aim for the fighters that are coming from the gate! The more we kill, the more we make Ivy's job easier!\" Arrows whistled through the air, some whiffing and some thumping into chests and skulls. Numerous volleys were shot as reinforcements continued to burst out of the gate. \"Split up into groups of 8! Protect the less experienced fighters!\" Glitchy ordered his soldiers. The enemy quickly retreated into the heart of the castle. \"Keep moving! Ivy said. \"Get some more soldiers up and over the walls.\" Avicadians rusher into the castle, continuing to fight as hard as they could. Suddenly, a vicious roar \u0026nbsp;echoed sounded from the top of the castle. \"Fools!\" A massive brown furred beast jumped down and began smashing the Basics. \"We're losing cannons! We need backup, Ivy!\" Emmaye called to his leader. \"How dare you attempt to destroy the home of Jerome?!\" The beast howled, he picked up a soldier and smashed his back down onto his knee, killing him swiftly. As he destroyed most of the Basics, the Icarus, and all of the Whishkys, he began to run towards Ivy. Ivy dived at him with his red sword ready to pierce through Jerome's heart. But he was too quick. He smashed Ivy to the ground and kicked him into the mess hall where the fighting was minimum. He raised his axe to deliver the killing blow, only to be interrupted by a blast of ice which smashed into his back. \"Uhhh!\" Jerome groaned as he fell to his knees. He turned around to see the blue eyes of the prisoner he had found on the battlefield. \"Frozen?\" Ivy couldn't believe his eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 22 (New)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Frozen began pacing towards Jerome, his eyes flaring in rage and confusion. \"You're suppose to be dead! What ARE you?!\" He growled. Right at that moment, the events that took place during Frozen's escape flashed through her mind. She was sitting in a chair with a rope tied around her and a pile of dynamite was getting ready to explode. Suddenly, a few minutes after Jerome had left the bunker, a golden armored warrior entered the room and stopped towards her. \"You killed my brother on the battlefield, and I'll enjoy killing you myself!\" He howled. He swung a golden dagger at Frozen, but she was quick. She stood up and spun around making the warrior's blade slice the rope that tied her to the chair. The warrior swung again, this time catching her arm. She fell onto the hard, obsidian floor and looked up as the man raised his blade for the final kill. Without thinking, Frozen swung her hands up and created a thick, light blue shield of ice. Crack! The dagger had been stuck inside the shield. Taking advantage, Frozen kicked the soldier away, managed to rip the dagger out of the shield and prepare to kill the assassin. Suddenly, She looked to her right and saw the fuse was nearly at the end. She turned around ready to flee, only to be attacked from behind by the guard. \"If I die, then you're coming with me!\" He shouted, anger clouding his mind. Frozen took the dagger and smashed the killer's neck with it, creating a huge gash. Blood shot out of his wound and he flopped onto the floor, heaving. She sprinted as fast as she could towards the gate and made it just in time to the outside. BOOM! Without looking back, Frozen fled into the forest, only caring about getting revenge on that mangy brown furred son of a bitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 23 (New)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Porky looked out his window, admiring the beautiful rolling hills and bright green trees. Interrupting his peace, he heard faint yelling from the trees and saw two Butter warriors running towards the kingdom, exhausted. \"Oh, great,\" he muttered. \"Time to call the others.\" Porky called the spies over and pointed out the mysterious runners. \"Strange.\" Snow said, studying the two clumsy men. \"Must have been attacked by robins.\" The group laughed and went back to their bunk beds. \"Newcomers! Go check out what those hooligans want!\" Deadlox commanded from his throne. Swiftly, he spies got dressed and ran outside to intercept the guards. \"What do you need?\" Martin asked one of the warriors. \"Mas...ter...Jerome...is being...attacked...we..need..reinforce...ments!\" The scout finished. \"Attacked?\" Snow said, suddenly realizing his friends and family back at home must have lead the assault. \"Please...let us speak...to Deadlox!\" The other thin scout gasped for air. The spies looked at each. \"Deadlox will not be able to assist you at this time. He is currently leading an assault on...uh...um....\" Badger tried to think up a convincing lie, only to be saved by Noel. \"Badlion. He took millions of soldiers with him.\" The scouts eyes widened. \"That isn't true! Deadlox always sends a letter to all members of the Butter Alliance! Youre liars!\" The scouts attempted to flee, but were quickly stopped by Buck. \"How about we make a deal? We give you 10,000 credits each to turn around and go back to that hairy animal.\" The scouts backed away. \"No! Why should we have to-\" he was stopped when Noel raised the tip of his sword to the scout's neck. \"Go.\" He exclaimed. The scouts ran off, tripping and crawling back to their kingdom.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 24 (Newest)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; As Frozen's flashback came to an end, all she could think about was slaying Jerome. Using her magic to create a compact ice shield and sword, she prepared to charge towards the massive brown beast, but he was ready. He flashed out an arm, sending Frozen flying across the room. He brought out his battle axe, and got into fighting position. Anger and determination kept Frozen moving as she dodged and sliced at Jerome. She had never fought this hard in her life, but her anger seemed to control her. Jerome swung his axe at her legs, and she hopped over. He went for a kick with his left leg, only to have an icy blade slice it open. \"Gahh!\" He screeched as blood began pouring out of his wound, all over the golden tile floor. \"You will die where you stand!\" Raising his axe, he threw it skillfully. Frozen attempted to dodge it, but it wasn't a complete success. She moved to the side to stop her skull from being smashed to bits, but it instead crashed into her shoulder, severely injuring her. \"Did that actually work?\" Jerome said, surprised. \"That's the first time it's ever connected!\" He began pacing towards Frozen, ready to deal the killing blow. As he grabbed her by the neck, he began tightening his grip to snap her neck. Suddenly, as she began fading, she noticed the palace was burning. Flames were everywhere and chunks of wood were falling from the ceiling. \"You destroy my home, I destroy your life!\" Jerome tightened his fist so quick that Frozen passed out, and she could hear her neck cracking a little. Soon, she gave up her struggling and let defeat take over. Slice! Jerome's grip lessened and Frozen fell to the floor, her eyes glazed, she could barely see what was going on, but what she knew was that Ivy had attacked the beast.\"Ivy! We must retreat! The palace is burning to ashes and we've practically killed everyone.\" Emmaye informed Ivy of their victory. \"Alright, help me bring her back to the kingdom.\" Ivy replied. As all the Avicus warriors spilled outside the burning castle, \u0026nbsp;and Ivy and Emmaye were at the back of the mob. All the fighters got out except a few Randy class troopers, Emmaye, Ivy, and Frozen who was still passed out. A massive body crashed in front of the remaining troopers and began killing them with ease. The Warriors who had already escaped attempted to assist, but were blocked off by a massive chunk of flaming wood. All the Randies that had been left in the castle were dead, so it was just Emmaye and Ivy left to kill the beast.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e[--To be continued.
