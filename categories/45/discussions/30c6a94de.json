That would imply that they are not upfront about what they are selling, and possibly misleading. I've never seen a server that does this. Selling a diamond sword for $500 is not scamming. Very few people donate to \"keep the server alive\", most do it for the perks. And no-one forces anyone to buy $500 ranks, so can you PLEASE stop trying to push the point that there are people scamming kids.","created_at":"2014/07/08 01:24:17 +0000","created_at_human":"July  8, 2014 at  1:07 AM UTC"}},{"id":34930,"unique_id":"34930-1806","author":{"id":49,"username":"The_Detonator_","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/4af926b9fa9c44139e28cfe823b27af1?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I was going to add in the line \"There are no big servers scamming kids\" But decided that someone may get confused.

Here's my POV. I've been playing OCN for 1.5 years now, and for the most part, it's been mainly pay to win free. The staff crew there made sure nothing was pay to win. So I guess having a slight advantage is better, because that's what OCN is basically, and I've enjoyed it for the past 1.5 years. Slight means small in degree, which basically sums up most non pay to win servers. What I don't understand is how you can say basically \"pay to win\" or no servers. There are alot of non pay to win servers out there, so there are still servers around to play. Besides, welcome to buisness, like the people above me have said. There will be changes you agree and disagree with. Live life to the fullest, and enjoy it as much as you can, and don't cry like a screaming gorrila about this change to a block game you supposedly enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","created_at":"2014/07/09 03:32:53 +0000","created_at_human":"July  9, 2014 at  3:07 AM UTC"}},{"id":36696,"unique_id":"36696-4631","author":{"id":303105,"username":"Teckky","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6211901b8c654997bd0215df21535eaf?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003eFirstly let me say all the information I am about to state has been told to me privately by a Mojang Developer (Grumm).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe EULA does effect all servers \"Pay To Win\" or not.
