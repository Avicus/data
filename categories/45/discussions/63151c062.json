This kit, pyro is getting too much nerves on me. This kit is too much OP, and it is only fair for those donors. I think you should change that iron axe to wooden sword or stone sword, and put the fire aspect on it, not the iron axe. That is too much OP in my case when i want to to play Nexus, and it gets irritated. So what do you guys think about this absolute-OP kit?\u003cbr\u003eI hope this case can be solved, and the fun playing on nexus would continue.\u003cbr\u003eThanks, \u003cbr\u003eSteven","body_tagged":"So as the topic says on the top, this is being ridiculous.
