One day, my cousin went to school, and she was feeling really bad. She went to art class, her next lesson, and laid her head down on the table. Then, one of the most messed up teachers came, this tall, fat and disgusting teacher. He was basically the meanest, most cruel person, and he said horrible things. He came, and started screaming at my cousin for laying her HEAD down on the TABLE. And then, the art teacher came, and she is a little bipolar, so she can be mean one minute and be happy the next. She started screaming at my cousin too, and then she felt a tear going down her cheek, and she told me it wasn't because she felt hurt, its because she knew that if someone else that was sensitive was victim to this, they would have gotten suicidal thoughts.
