I tried to support mapmaking as much as possible, while always being honest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I love about the map making really isn't just the building. I love trying out new things, both buildwise and gameplaywise.\u003cbr\u003eI tried to predict the gameplay of my maps, before they would get played and edit them if I expected flaws.\u003cbr\u003eAs little as most of my maps were used, most of them followed my exact gameplay plans, which I guess is a good thing.\u003cbr\u003e(Please don't talk about 'The Toys', it was shit I know...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'm feeling great lately. Really busy IRL, but Minecraft is always high on my priority list.\u003cbr\u003eStupid as it sounds, it did help me get through depressing stages in life and I improved my autistic social skills by doing so.\u003cbr\u003eI'm working hard on what I enjoy doing, and everytime it pays of a little, it motivates me even more :)","created_at":"2018/01/09 00:18:15 +0000","created_at_human":"January  9, 2018 at 12:01 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":386468,"unique_id":"386468-1151","author":{"id":497178,"username":"twopump","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/58b9ab0f83cf43c1b53baecd64ed2838?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"I never really knew you, but it is nice to see that you stuck around for a long, long time.
