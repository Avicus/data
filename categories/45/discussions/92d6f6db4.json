I am applying for mod with the intention of getting Senior Mod quickly. I have been criticized for the methods I use to push my agenda on avicus which include: threatening, ddosing, keylogging, leaking, and blackmailing. I find my methods effective and the best way to get avicus staff which I am generally extremely critical of to do things I believe are good either for myself or for the network. In an effort to become more translucent with the community and staff team to gain their trust despite the methods I have used in the past I will be accepting questions both on TS and here with full honesty as long as these questions are of substance and are not useless questions such as \"What is your favorite color\" or questions soliciting certain sensitive material such as \"what was said in staff chat on 12/11/2016 at 5:30 pm?\". An example of a question would be \"How do you justify keylogging or ddosing morally?\" or \"How did you get steven unbanned?\". Please note that I can and will only answer the questions to the best of my ability so if I do not know certain information I cannot share it. I would ask that despite the controversial topics and questions being asked staff allow this chat to remain open since I do this with the intention of being honest with the community and them. I hope that at the end of this you can see the benefits to having me as a Senior Mod and will support me in this en-devour. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will cover a few things first:\u003cbr\u003eI want Senior Mod to fix TS, the staff team and the rules. In fixing TS I intend to overhaul TS and rebuild it to get rid of useless features while retaining the core elements that make our TS such a great community building service. In fixing the staff team I intend to change the moderating program to focus more on activity and training especially in the mentor department. In fixing the rules I intend to make a public guideline as to which the staff team will abide by with reasonable leniency for moderator discretion. In addition the rules would be made to encompass the widest variety of infractions yet as to leave no doubt when punishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks.","body_tagged":"Howdy there,\u003cbr\u003eI am Zac.
