You oculd build a cheaper PC that can perform the same quality as a MAC but a mac is usually \"overpriced\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there are more software available to PC so you could get some useful software as well. OF course, Apple does have good high end software such as final cut pro but there is more software availble to PC than Mac's in general. I would not really want to game on a MAC because im not really used to it and its to complicated for others such as my self (up to you of course). Some games aren't available on MAC but most games are typically available to PC. Also, Mac is not really built for gaming but more of like in a workstation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout the viresus thing. Mac's can STILL get viruses. It's just that there are fewer viruses on a MAC because there is like a system to protect it and people don't really make viruses for MAC. PC on the other hand tends to get viruses but hey, just get a free AVG anti virus software or something. IT would take care of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, the most #1 reason why i think you should get or build (prefer building) a PC is because you can easily upgrade it cheaper. Think about it: if your upgrading a MAC, you would basically have to buy another $1000+ computer. On the other hand, you can switch your video card, processor, etc.. and upgrade for a much cheaper cost. And if you decide to upgrade your PC, you dont have to by another one but just replace some of the parts which is cheaper. The main disadvantage of Mac's imo is the fact you cannot really upgrade MAC parts because its hard and Apple simply wont let you do it cuz its a closed platform. You cannot really customize a Mac. (unless\u0026nbsp; know how to upgrade Mac parts)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your PC is broken, easy to fix. Get a new part and bam and i think its free compared taking a mac to a specialist (idk about it but pls tell me if im wrong). I would not want to go to a repair guy fixing my mac. too much of a hassle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMac to most people is user friendly to some people and its operating system looks better than windows.
