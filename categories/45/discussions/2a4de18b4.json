My father was the\r\nreason of it all. He had a great job at a rich business company. The school\r\nthat I went to was a good and decent one; I never got bullied, and always had\r\ngood grades. This went on for about a year.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;On my sixth birthday, my father wasn’t at home\r\na lot. He was working all the time. However, when he did come home, he was\r\nusually quiet. My brothers and I including my mother were worried about my\r\nfather. He was usually loud talking on the phone, or talking about the people\r\nat work with my mother. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe day\r\ncame when my mother questioned my father on the sudden silence and emotion.\r\nThat broke out into a huge fight. Then the silence and sadness went to my mom.\r\nDays later, I made up the courage to ask my mom what daddy was mad about. She\r\ntold me in a lone voice that it was just money and job problems. As months went\r\nby, we couldn’t get any more furniture and couldn’t go to restaurants. We\r\nbasically lost our belongings. This caused the fights between my parents to\r\nprogress rapidly. \r\n\r\nWe finally\r\nchose to move to a very small apartment… \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is\r\nwhere the story gets eccentric. This didn’t really cause an effect to my mother\r\nand brothers, but it did to my father. My father started banging his head on\r\nthe walls. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy mom\r\nwould tell us to go into the bedroom, and then she would clean up the dripping\r\nblood coming from my dad’s head. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt got\r\nso bad he started talking and whispering at the corner of the wall. Then he\r\nstarted blaming it on my family. I sometimes woke up in the morning and saw my\r\nyounger brother crying. I went over to him and asked him what was wrong. He\r\nthen pulled up his shirt, and honestly what I saw was traumatizing. Dark purple\r\nbruises covering his entire back. The same thing happened to my other brother,\r\nthen soon, it happened to me. My father had become worse than crazy, he was\r\ninsane.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;He beat us to pulp with his belt. My sweet\r\nmother though, she had it worse. It wasn’t only the belt; it was glass cups\r\ngetting destroyed on her head. We tried to take care of our mom the best we\r\ncould, but it was so hard. We tried to escape but found all the doors and\r\nwindows locked. We were completely trapped in this small and tiny apartment. \r\n\r\nOne\r\nnight came when my mom started yelling at my insane father. She sought after a\r\ndivorce. Right after that statement, my father was set on killing my mother. I\r\nheard the three specific noises. The first noise was the metal clanking coming\r\nfrom the cupboard. The second noise was the deep footsteps urgently walking.\r\nThe last noise was a scream, a high pitched scream, the scream of a full grown\r\nwoman. The one who was my flesh and blood. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy\r\nbrothers quickly ran out of the room, as usual I walked with them only to find\r\nin my living room, my mother’s dead body slit in the throat. My father standing\r\nwith a kitchen knife covered in red blood. In a usual horror story, the maniac\r\nsmiles, my dad wasn’t smiling. Instead he had a big grimace, breathing heavily\r\nlike a famished wolf. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe\r\nquickly jumped on my brother and stabbed him in his eye. Dropping to the\r\nground, my younger brother and I ran into our room. I locked the door, and then\r\nrealized my brother wasn’t there. I heard another body fall to the ground. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nI stood\r\nthere trying to hold back my tears. I flinched when I heard the slamming\r\nagainst the door, the only way I could get away was through the window. Even\r\nthough we were three stories up, it was either get tortured by a knife, or\r\nescape with broken limbs. I took anything I could find and tried to break the\r\nwindow, until it finally cracked. I kicked the window which completely broke\r\nthe window. That’s also when the slamming against the door stopped.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;My father said on the other side of the door a\r\nmessage. “Your mother, your two brothers, they are all dead. This small\r\ndwelling, it controls me, it told me to do it. Those pigs deserved to die; now\r\nit’s just you”. The door splintered leaving a small opening. He finally said\r\n“You won’t be able to escape”. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe was\r\nright. The courage I built up to jump, it got destroyed just by the change of\r\nhis voice. I came to a conclusion that this wasn’t my father anymore. It was a\r\nfanatic that lived with me ever since I was born, who planned to kill us all.\r\nHe was someone you will never be able to escape. That was the last moment I saw\r\nthe fanatic. That was the last moment I could feel. That was the last moment of\r\nmy life.","body_tagged":"\u003cb\u003eThe Title Says It All, However This Story Is Much Longer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClaustrophobia\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \r\n\r\nWhen I\r\nwas five years old, we had a big house and a good life.
