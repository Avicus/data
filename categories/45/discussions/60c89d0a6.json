Its Parkr_. Just wanted to say goodbye. It's been a good 4 years. I wanted to pop on the server today and I found out it closed. I haven't played Minecraft in maybe 5 months and it broke my heart seeing that this server has shutdown. Most of you may not know me, I like to think I was very well known about 2 years back. I had multiple friends and was known as a very fun and good person. I quit playing Minecraft because it wasn't amusing anymore. But all good things must come to an end. You may look at my stats and think I wasn't amazing and I wasn't but I've had amazing times in this game. The only players I can remember is Dani and Nebbsy. If you guys are reading this, thanks. I've had fun with you guys and so many others.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e-Parkr_","body_tagged":"Hey everyone. Its Parkr_. Just wanted to say goodbye. It's been a good 4 years.
