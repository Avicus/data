There's not a perfect way to make this, unless you take some time to make the kits perfectly, and test them. But kits like Stomper that have no weakness need to have one. Make a kit that doesn't take damage from Stomper, while it also has it's own perk. And make a kit with something to fight that kits perk, as well as having it's own. It could make a circle basically.

I've stated these in my original post, but I think that if we brought back the old Walls, with a few updates that were needed, then it would become popular again. I personally have always loved Walls more than any other gamemode, but I stopped playing because of some updates. And I know I'm not the only one that stopped because of those, because Walls died within a month after those updates came out.","created_at":"2016/12/18 20:05:24 +0000","created_at_human":"December 18, 2016 at  8:12 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":347631,"unique_id":"347631-3505","author":{"id":120167,"username":"Posighdun","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/89f514e1f0f549778ddc77ef030a8b46?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I agree with you in certain areas like the fact that without walls we wouldn't have gotten the exposure we received years ago.

You guys are good at what you do, but you don't know the maps like Walls players do. You guys deal with DTM so much that it's much harder to tell if a Walls map will have good gameplay or not. I'm simply asking to take that into consideration when you look at Walls maps. Maybe look at the comments from Walls players to see what they think. We (Walls players) can work on commenting what we think of maps and why, but we should start making maps as well. Lol\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-My opinions, if you have any questions just ask.

I agree to a point with this comment, but not fully. I think that if Walls was brought back with the help of the community and people who played Walls before it was removed it could become like it was before. Walls was very popular a couple years ago, and I think it still can be.

In my opinion the best way to fix this problem is make Stomper not do damage to other players, but simply not take fall damage.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e-Just to add to this though, height limits can be lowered, but not the the extent that they were. For a long time the height limits were 256, which is the max height limit in Minecraft. We can move these down without making them too low. 100 blocks from the highest point on a map seems more then fair, honestly.

Good idea, but the kits weren't balanced. There was still kits that were just overall better. I don't disagree with having an overpowered kit, but there needs to be one or more kits that can contradict that kit and have their own overpowered item or perk. There's not a perfect way to make this, unless you take some time to make the kits perfectly, and test them. But kits like Stomper that have no weakness need to have one. Make a kit that doesn't take damage from Stomper, while it also has it's own perk. And make a kit with something to fight that kits perk, as well as having it's own. It could make a circle basically.

The only way to really fix this is for the community to make more maps that work well with Walls. Another slight problem I've seen with Map Devs is that sometimes to a person that has played Walls the map looks amazing, but to a Map Dev it looks really bad. I understand that Map Devs are trained to know more about maps and gameplay, but if I'm completely honest a person who has played Walls for a long time knows if a map will be good or not better then a Map Dev does.
