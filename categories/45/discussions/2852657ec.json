My brother basically asked me to give the headphones and my ipad to him and he started to talk stupid stuff to gonzo which is i'm really blushing at that time and covering myself with my blanket (i'm nervous as hell...). after that, i suddenly grab the headphones and my ipad from him and he just eavesdrop on our conversation so i coudn't talk to gonzo that much. I'm even removing my headphones to hear what is he talking about to my cousin and they changed the topic to tree houses. I began tallking a little at that time and i didn't realized my brother is still eavesdropping me. I just ignore him but idk why do i still feel bothered.
