I'm only here online in the forums for a while cause i'm on a vacation. It was crazy and awesome at the same time. First of all, i'm in a hotel for a while right now which is it's only day 2 of our bus tour. But the niagra trip is the best part ever. I crossed the boarder going to canada in just a few minutes (it really sucks i want to stay there longer) when i saw the falls, it's majestically beautiful especially when you're up close to it. Here comes the craziest part. I rode the \"lady of the mist\" boat and everyone was wearing ponchos there. When the boat is heading towards the mist, it was really like raining over there that my shoes got wet. My previous trips are just going to the statue of liberty, times square and empire state building (at the 108 floor) and a little shopping too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePictures (coming soon)","body_tagged":"Hello guys!
