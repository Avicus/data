This game has brought me so much, my friends, fun and so much more that helped me escape my troubles in real life when i had them. But at the same time, I feel like it also has taken way too much from me. Why am i leaving?\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e1. I have been playing this game for 4 years now and i feel like it is about time for me to quit. I have tried to quit before but the community just kept on pulling me back to the game. But now i feel like i really have lost interest in this game. MC has taken way too much of my time away from me. I have only just realised that during holidays, I spend half of my whole day sitting infront of a computer playing MC.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e2. I also want to tryout some other games that I have never had the chance to play because MC took all of my time away from me. osu for example is a game that I want to play. I also want to get better at League so i can polish my yasuo and zed mechanics so i can bring cancer to the whole world since that was my dream as a child jkjk.\u003cbr\u003e3. Recently I have been quite involved in tournaments and they r a trek for me to play in since im Australian and i need to wake up at like 2am to play them. I guess i could just not play in them but i do have to eventually show up at some tournaments if i still want to be on the team. This has taken so much sleep off me and it makes my weekends feel pretty terrible.\u003cbr\u003e4. I play this game for fun, and im pretty sure everyone does. If u dont play it for fun then i guess u should just quit because there is no point if ur not having fun. But at the same time, I also want to win tournaments. I think in terms of raw ability, im pretty decent at pvp. I click 12-13 cps and have good aim where i can predict where my opponent is going, direction of them getting kb'd etc. But after time I realised that I can never win and be at the top. Because i get 360 ping whenever i connect to this server. And really no offences to anyone, but its kind of frustrating for me to deal with getting beaten by some person who isnt good at all but has like 0 ping. Some of u guys might understand because u also have shit ping like me. And its really annoying especially in tournaments. After 4 years worth of game experience, i figured that the most important aspect of this game is ping and nothing else and i can never be good no matter how much i click or how good i aim.\u003cbr\u003eThankyou to all of those people i have met along my journey and for being good friends with. Some of us had so much in common and this game has really opened my eyes up to the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e-Jexel\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e-Krovax\u003cbr\u003e-Midas\u003cbr\u003e-Ref\u003cbr\u003e-Homies\u003cbr\u003e-Zicuri altho u can be a dick sometimes\u003cbr\u003e-Squadcatt (OCN)\u003cbr\u003e-Squadcatt (avicus)\u003cbr\u003e-Ciyh\u003cbr\u003e-Bleeple\u003cbr\u003e-Jaystah\u003cbr\u003e-Ava\u003cbr\u003e-Celestial\u003cbr\u003eyea i dont have too many friends cause im a loner ;-;\u003cbr\u003eI will still be streaming for avicus during tm6 but i will be stopping competitive mc.
