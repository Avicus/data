I was addicted and had a really nice time with all the players. Now then I moved on to nexus/nebula where I met even more great friends. Now when mc zone many of these players left. It was sad to see them go. They where such a large part of why I would play on the server. Avicus was still great. I made loads more friends and had loads of fun. But like all great things they begin to decline. The avicus player base was dropping until it only had about 200-300 on a day. Then I heard news of the avicore update. I thought that it would bring back all of my old friends from the beginning. On the first day I felt very optimistic. 600 players on. That was the most players the server had seen in months. But then came another decline. Many players and staff members began to leave. The constant bickering between OCN and Avicus continued which lead to hacking and other unecessary things. Avicus just doesn't feel as great as the old mc zone and many players hackusate me which I just get sick and tired of. Many players have criticised staff members which have led to demotions. And personally I don't blame any staff members for getting angry at a player because anger is part of a human and staff members are human. But I'm going to stick with this server because I believe it can become the great server it once was.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to disagree with me on any points but I just wanted to share my feelings about the server.","body_tagged":"To start of with I found this server through the walls game mode.
