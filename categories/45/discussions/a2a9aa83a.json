Me on an old I5 2500k is on 300-1500fps not overclocked yet this old i5 ive beats the AMD FX 4300 by 2.5 on cpu boss '\u003ca href=\"http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-vs-AMD-FX-4300\" title=\"Link: http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-vs-AMD-FX-4300\"\u003ehttp://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-vs-AMD-FX-4300\u003c/a\u003e' and basically kicks its butt. So overall if you want them fps for decent price using AMD use a AMD FX 6300 six core but even this cant beat any I7's. Also take into consideration it depends on the settings you play the game on.","created_at":"2015/12/22 17:48:25 +0000","created_at_human":"December 22, 2015 at  5:12 PM UTC"}},{"id":261094,"unique_id":"261094-3712","author":{"id":245659,"username":"vladthegreat100","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0657f906e1f29521397b9adcaac4a5fc?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"The average eye can only see 60fps max, so that extra 8 gb were a bit overboard unless your gonna start playing some mlg GTA V on that thing.\u003cbr\u003eIf its\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eonly\u003c/b\u003e for minecraft then ofc its 100% a waste of money","body_tagged":"The average eye can only see 60fps max, so that extra 8 gb were a bit overboard unless your gonna start playing some mlg GTA V on that thing.\u003cbr\u003eIf its\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eonly\u003c/b\u003e for minecraft then ofc its 100% a waste of money","created_at":"2015/12/22 17:57:35 +0000","created_at_human":"December 22, 2015 at  5:12 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":261092,"unique_id":"261092-1855","author":{"id":274543,"username":"Jerseys","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/08978025bab24803ac36a85c6a8ff5af?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;\"\u003eSorry to bust your bubbles but they aren't .
