Accept the fight, but fight naked. Nobody wants to get in a fight with a naked person. Jump around and walk up to the bully and he'll start to back away. He'll be too grossed out to fight you and there would be a sense of awkwardness for him to fight you. If you are doing this with your brother, then it'll be even more awkward for the bullies.","body_tagged":"This may seem really weird, but it will really mess up the bully's mind.
