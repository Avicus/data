Sometimes it's just temporary and sometimes it's a permeant thing that can really hurt a lot. But you always have to stay strong, just remember that. Always try to stay strong, everyone has their bad, good and absolutely amazing days that they'll remember forever. Everyone should be equal in this world and not judge each other, but with conflict there's always some type of solution. Sometimes the solution is hard to find and sometimes it's easy, there will always be people who have different views on things no one is exactly the same ever. Talking to the person who I had a fight with or had a misunderstanding with always seems to help me, but when you talk to the person just make sure not to overreact or say anything offensive no matter how heated the conversation gets. If talking doesn't work/saying sorry, then I honestly don't think that person is such a good friend. All of us usually accidently say something we don't always mean which can lead to the other person responding to it in a wrong way. I'm not sure why you aren't fond of this person because I don't know the whole story. But always try to get to know them better, there may be a nicer side to them.

If the person really cares about you they won't expect you to change for them in order for you to fit in and meet their expectations, they'll like you for who you are. I've been called an attention seeker quite a few times as well, and sometimes I do admit that it's true because I do sometimes try to draw attention to get more people to like me which I know is wrong. Everyone tries so hard to fit in but they change something about them most of the time to do it. Never change for anybody, sometimes it takes the right people to see the shining star in you.
