Then you got the immature kids who just scream, HACker, HACKS, and just cuss just cause they think its cool. The community is going down. I mean, it was abd already but nows its just worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of updates, i guess its ok. No change really. Just dont like 1.8 due to the water :/ I personally lost intrest in minecraft due to updates not being fun anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of community and server netowrk base, ya its going down ish. idk\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMinecraft will last a pretty long time but it will probably will get no popular anymore. Well, it would be still popular but people wouldnt play it as much","created_at":"2014/12/22 07:52:21 +0000","created_at_human":"December 22, 2014 at  7:12 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":126725,"unique_id":"126725-2909","author":{"id":4676,"username":"Bluecichlid","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/ecd03ae2363446ad821bd58c102379ed?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"What has lead some of you to believe Mojang is now \"money hungry\"?
