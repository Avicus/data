I played with a lot of my in real like friends and we loved to play walls. I always remember that I thought nebula was terrible. Basically, I started to love the server and I got more walls kits. That's when I wanted to buy Gold rank. I bought gold rank and I was pretty happy. Then all of my irl friends stopped playing Minecraft in general, and it was just me playing it. I had no one to talk to on skype, because I didn't want to talk to \"strangers\". I finally overcome that fear and added StormzInvader and avumbaca\u0026nbsp;(Avy) on skype, and I talked to them. Avumbuca\u0026nbsp;told me about TeamSpeak, so I joined it and met some new people. After getting involved on that side of the community, I joined the forums, and I was pretty much a forum spammer, but I didn't do it intentionally. I donated to emerald later that year and got banned on the forums. I waited it out and then got appealed, and realised I had been invited to a team. I joined the team (CrookArmy), and it was a walls team. I started enjoying nebula in 2015 aswell. Crookarmy was my first ever team and I loved to muck around in their fun scrims. That later disbanded so I made a new team named Xenarch. We never actually won a match but we were really close friends. Glesmon and I got into a fight and everyone started to leave breaking our friendship up. For like 2 months being disbanded I created a new one and named it Xenarch, and Cake later joined.
