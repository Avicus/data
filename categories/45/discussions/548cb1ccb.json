It can be described as a crawling devil.\r\nIt has the red eyes, and he walks on my walls. He’s just like me; I always\r\nwanted to walk on the walls when I saw those action movies. Oh well, a child’s\r\ndream doesn’t last.\u0026nbsp; Then the nails, they\r\nare sharp and long. He’s just like me; I used to have long nails when I was a\r\nkid. I liked them sharp, but now they are short. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nI realized he knew all my secrets, like the most embarrassing\r\nmoment in my life. And the first lie I ever told. He would always tell me it, and\r\nremind me of how bad it was.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere is something that scares me even more. I have a secret that\r\nwe both must hide. The “thing” killed my mother. She died when I was 12 years\r\nold. I saw its big smile, as it stabbed my mother’s face. \u0026nbsp;However, instead of telling anybody or the\r\npolice… I kept it a secret. There was something that told me not to tell\r\nanyone. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe exact same thing happened to my father, but I still kept it a\r\nsecret. I couldn’t tell anybody. No one could know. I have been living in the\r\nsame house with the bodies buried in the backyard. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo I have been going through 8 years of this madness. It stalks\r\nme, it annoys me. I have kept it for so long here, and now… I am going to get\r\nrid of it.\r\n\r\nNight falls and I fall with it. I am fast asleep, my eyes filled\r\nwith darkness. It feels like forever until I awake in an endless hallway oblivious\r\nto my surrounding. I walk through the hallway, and find doors. I open some of\r\nthem, and find my memories. Some of them are bad and some of them are good. I\r\nwalk for what seemed like years going through doors of memories, until I reach\r\nthe present.\u0026nbsp; I walk ahead and only see\r\npitch black. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat’s when I hear a stomping sound. I quickly look behind, and\r\nsee the “thing” crawling faster than ever. I wasn’t afraid though. I ran to the\r\nbeast and swung my fist at its cold blooded face. It squealed and took a large\r\nknockback. I see it on the ground about to take a jump. And oh boy, it sure\r\ntook a jump. It jumped 50 feet in the air, and landed its entire body on mine.\r\nI cough out blood, and then punched it in the face again. My rage made me punch\r\nit multiple times as the chunks of its cheek fell off. It made another\r\ndisgusting squeal, and fell back. It ran away, but I chased it. I kept running\r\nand running till it actually stopped. I give it a kick in the stomach. When it\r\nfell onto the ground, I stepped on its face, and tried crushing it. Then it was\r\nbarely alive. I prepared my foot to step on its face one last time. \r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u003cspan\u003eBefore I could get the last hit, I woke up in my bathroom. I was\r\nin shock cleaning myself up.
