Also, whoever says that they get bad ping, I get worse, everyone was telling me that I teleport a lot in Avicus and I lag a lot. But this isn't because of my Computer or Internet, it is because Avicus is hosted in Canada. Then my second point is, that we shouldn't make an extra server anyway if you think about it. Averagely, we get 600 players each day and our server capacity is 2500. We need more popularity to make another server for Avicus, otherwise it is no use, we would get 300 in each server which is useless. If we boost the popularity up, to 2000 players a day, then we could implement this new server. Sorry if this induces rage but to boost popularity, of which of mczone, I think that we need Survival Games back, it is the main thing that boosted up the popularity in Mczone, it was the reason that me and April joined this server in the first place, of Survival Games. Of course, we have elimination, but it is doing us nothing, we do not get any player from it, it is a great idea, but we have Nexus and Nebula.
