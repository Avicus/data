So please, for the love god, do your reserach before you talk. Unlike you, I actually look at comparison videos, tech reviews and amazon reviews of most well known keyboards and mice, and to my knowledge, the people that actually have the sense to do their research say Razer is bad compared to other well known companies.

Unfortunatly for you, I actually KNOW what I'm talking about. Razer uses chesp material, for a higher price, end of story. Again, they don't make bad products, they make ok products. But for a company that size, I would expect at least some of their products to have somehting else other than plastic.. Just look at the Corsair K70 RGB. It has the best Multimedia Controls Ive ever seen. It has 2 choices of GERMAN made Cherry MX keyswitches. It's also made out of ALUMINUM. It has all the other features the BlackWidow Chroma has and a couple more. And it's LESS MONEY. Have you ever experiences a Cherry MX Blue switch? Or a Razer Green switch. If you have, which I doubt, you will notice the difference between the feel; the Cherry MX blues have the same click and tactile feedback, but feel A LOT lighter, and I am NOT exaggerating.
