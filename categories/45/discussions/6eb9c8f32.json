I don't know if you remember me but you accused me of something I didn't do and banned me. I haven't been able to play and I don't know how to get unbanned so if it is possible could you please unban me? Oh, the reason you banned me was for ban evading but please hear me out. I was trying to get my brother's account unbanned so he could play with me. His account is Boboyjoe153 and he got banned for a glitch in the programming of the map. I was there watching him play on Skywars on Avicus because we shared the same computer at the time. So anyways what happened was this, the two teams had been building bridges across to each other's islands and he ran across one of the bridges and noticed there was a guy from the enemy team below him on another bridge. He jumped down on top of the guy and was able to knock the enemy player off the bridge and out of the world but when he did the enemy guy noticed when my brother jumped down on top of him and tried to fight back by punching my brother with his sword. At that moment the game started to glitch for no reason and then suddenly a message appeared on the screen that said something like \"You have been banned for anti-knock-back.\" and then listed the time it happened. That is the truth, I swear on my life. We both really loved playing on this server and we both really want to play more so if you could find it in your heart to unban us we would really appreciate it. We really look forward to playing on the server again and we'll see you there. :)","body_tagged":"Hi, Tynvale?
