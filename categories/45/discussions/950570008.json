I have left Avicus and Minecraft in general roughly one and a half months ago. I left without properly saying goodbye, and I truly regret leaving an amazing community without saying goodbye. I would like to keep this rather short and simple, but I would like to thank each and every single one of you for giving me the best gaming experience ever. I have thought about leaving many many times before, but the amazing community has kept me for such a long time. However, after my demotion I just felt there was no need to be here. I felt that I have served enough time here, and I needed to move on. I concluded my thoughts and decided to leave. I have burned my eyesight for this game, lost almost all of my physical fitness abilities, and dropped my grades and lost motivation in school. After only one month+ of leaving, I have gotten almost all of my physical fitness abilities that I had before playing so much Minecraft, became an honor roll student in my school meaning I have gotten straight A's for the last half of the school year. I know that if I come back to Minecraft, I will go back to being unhealthy. Enough rambling, seriously, I couldn't thank you all enough. My journey here on Avicus has been amazing, I met so many people, became staff on here, which was my dream. However, we all have our times where we feel we need to leave, and my time was last month.
