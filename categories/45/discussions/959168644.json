I could legitimately rant on forever but I'm narrowing it down to one word - divided.

Even before I was a Sr mod (like when I was a mod on this server or OCN), I was able to see that promotions aren't always based on how much you 'tryhard'. Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod. Attitude, maturity, and the quality (?) of the work I've always found is a bigger aspect in regards to promotions. However, sitting back waiting to be picked doesn't always work (or at least not as quickly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I got mod is very much like you story. On OCN, a referral was created and I got Jr. After being promoted, and even to this day, I've been generally pretty laid back. When I came over here, I felt like I had something the Sr team wanted (or as Greg put it \"we need good mods\" - ones with experience). And then a few months (maybe it was weeks honestly) into my time as a mod here, I was messaged by an admin at the time telling me they were looking for more Srs, and that if I showed what I could do, I might get Sr. At that time, I had no idea what I was suppose to do. I tried to be online as much as I could for that week, and tried to be the best moderator I could. After the week ended, I never heard back from that admin \u0026amp; I presumed I had failed that opportunity (or whatever you want to call it). A few more weeks passed and I retired from all staff positions. I came back to the staff team 3 months later, and was promoted to Sr within a few days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I'm not saying that promoting me to Sr a few days after I came back was a great choice. Heck, it was a pretty bad choice in my opinion.

Sorry about that. Just like focus on the first and last paragraphs","body_tagged":"Alright, so here's my 2 cents on this. Even before I was a Sr mod (like when I was a mod on this server or OCN), I was able to see that promotions aren't always based on how much you 'tryhard'. Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod. Attitude, maturity, and the quality (?) of the work I've always found is a bigger aspect in regards to promotions. However, sitting back waiting to be picked doesn't always work (or at least not as quickly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I got mod is very much like you story. On OCN, a referral was created and I got Jr. After being promoted, and even to this day, I've been generally pretty laid back. When I came over here, I felt like I had something the Sr team wanted (or as Greg put it \"we need good mods\" - ones with experience). And then a few months (maybe it was weeks honestly) into my time as a mod here, I was messaged by an admin at the time telling me they were looking for more Srs, and that if I showed what I could do, I might get Sr. At that time, I had no idea what I was suppose to do. I tried to be online as much as I could for that week, and tried to be the best moderator I could. After the week ended, I never heard back from that admin \u0026amp; I presumed I had failed that opportunity (or whatever you want to call it). A few more weeks passed and I retired from all staff positions. I came back to the staff team 3 months later, and was promoted to Sr within a few days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I'm not saying that promoting me to Sr a few days after I came back was a great choice. Heck, it was a pretty bad choice in my opinion.

Even before I was a Sr mod (like when I was a mod on this server or OCN), I was able to see that promotions aren't always based on how much you 'tryhard'. Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod. Attitude, maturity, and the quality (?) of the work I've always found is a bigger aspect in regards to promotions. However, sitting back waiting to be picked doesn't always work (or at least not as quickly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I got mod is very much like you story. On OCN, a referral was created and I got Jr. After being promoted, and even to this day, I've been generally pretty laid back. When I came over here, I felt like I had something the Sr team wanted (or as Greg put it \"we need good mods\" - ones with experience). And then a few months (maybe it was weeks honestly) into my time as a mod here, I was messaged by an admin at the time telling me they were looking for more Srs, and that if I showed what I could do, I might get Sr. At that time, I had no idea what I was suppose to do. I tried to be online as much as I could for that week, and tried to be the best moderator I could. After the week ended, I never heard back from that admin \u0026amp; I presumed I had failed that opportunity (or whatever you want to call it). A few more weeks passed and I retired from all staff positions. I came back to the staff team 3 months later, and was promoted to Sr within a few days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I'm not saying that promoting me to Sr a few days after I came back was a great choice. Heck, it was a pretty bad choice in my opinion. I had to struggle with learning all the new changes in the staff team, the server, and on top of all that learn how to be a Sr. But what was different this time vs when I was offered a chance to be a Sr was that I actually felt like I had done something to \"prove\" myself. Just around this time I was in the process of revamping the SMedia team (I could have done a better job on the whole thing, I'll admit that any day). During this time I was able to show the Admins (and I guess anyone else who cared, I really only communicated with Posighdun) that I was able to do work to a decent level, and that I had initiative to work on something that no one else put any effort into for months prior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I'm starting to feel that this is just a post about me, so let's get back to the point I was trying to make. How much you 'tryhard' and at what level you do it doesn't always matter. Like doing work is great, but it's more than just that. This is why not every guy you see tryharding gets the promotion they were after.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eedit: wow ok this post really is more about me than the point I'm trying to make. Sorry about that. Just like focus on the first and last paragraphs","body_tagged":"Alright, so here's my 2 cents on this. Even before I was a Sr mod (like when I was a mod on this server or OCN), I was able to see that promotions aren't always based on how much you 'tryhard'. Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod. Attitude, maturity, and the quality (?) of the work I've always found is a bigger aspect in regards to promotions. However, sitting back waiting to be picked doesn't always work (or at least not as quickly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I got mod is very much like you story. On OCN, a referral was created and I got Jr. After being promoted, and even to this day, I've been generally pretty laid back. When I came over here, I felt like I had something the Sr team wanted (or as Greg put it \"we need good mods\" - ones with experience). And then a few months (maybe it was weeks honestly) into my time as a mod here, I was messaged by an admin at the time telling me they were looking for more Srs, and that if I showed what I could do, I might get Sr. At that time, I had no idea what I was suppose to do. I tried to be online as much as I could for that week, and tried to be the best moderator I could. After the week ended, I never heard back from that admin \u0026amp; I presumed I had failed that opportunity (or whatever you want to call it). A few more weeks passed and I retired from all staff positions. I came back to the staff team 3 months later, and was promoted to Sr within a few days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I'm not saying that promoting me to Sr a few days after I came back was a great choice.

There's a line that everyone sees differently, the line called \"should I be laid-back right now or not?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think that I'm very laid-back, but I know some people would disagree with me, then again, those are the same people that get a lot of punishments from me because I asked them to stop 5 times and they didn't so I kick them. xD Anyway, I've always taken a more laid-back approach about some things, like caps and spam for example. But I've always been a lot more strict about suicide encouragement and racism. Honestly a lot of \"tryhard\" mods are just more strict about more things, and their opinion (that makes sense to an extent) is that the rules are rules, no exceptions.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to add on, I've always noticed a line between Senior staff and Moderators. I think that most of the time, a regular player, or someone who hasn't been around the staff team much, would say that the Mods and Seniors seem to get along and they all (for the most part) know each other, and I would agree, sort of. From the first time I was Mod, and now, I've always felt like I don't know anything more than the community does about anything. That's not always a bad thing, but it is a bit frustrating when I feel like if they had ran through some ideas with the Moderators, just to make sure there's not some major flaw, or some new idea that could work really well, with whatever they are making, it might turn out better and not completely fail.
