Today I made a hard\u0026nbsp;but easy decision. \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026nbsp;I might not be on Avicus or Minecraft for a long time soon. The game is just getting really boring and so is the server. I had a lot of good things go on the game and such but I think its time for me to move on to other things. I have school and big tests and projects coming up. I also haven't getting a proper sleep time. Instead of 8 hours I would now usually get 6-7 which isn't good. Plus everyone I know stopped playing it. I'm better at other games as well like CoD, Just Cause, and others. On the weekends when I have nothing to do I just play Minecraft all day and have no fun. I hope you guys understand. I'm not sure when I'm going to leave but, its soon, probably in 2-3 days. I want to thank everyone on Avicus for letting me play and have fun for the past 3 years. Some people I want to thank personally are;\u0026nbsp;Danii,\u0026nbsp;armoredpotato,\u0026nbsp;Nebbsy, Nemo, GBeanzy, IzikW, maxweberh, Tigger_the_bear,\u0026nbsp;Nanoo, DeliciousShoesHD, SirCyaniide, SoccerMaster, FutbolHunter, Clijmart and\u0026nbsp;Kojapan17.
