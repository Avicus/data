So my question is when is avicus going to come up with a decent anti-cheat? At the moment you can't even detect a simple autoclicker. The \" nodus days \" are long gone, you need to build a better anti cheat or this server is going to be full of hackers. If you cannot build a decent anti cheat, which is understandable as finding people who can do so are difficult to find. Partner with some other server, badlion, kohi, something like that. Those servers have very good anti cheats, in fact kohi even screenshares players as ghost clients are difficult to detect, which brings me to my next point, Start screen sharing people. I understand that the current avicus staff team will not have any experience in doing so but its required and you can always learn from youtube or people who do know how to do so( gods like me xD ) Why is it required? Ghost clients at the moment are only detectable by badlion, from the huge number of minecraft servers out there, badlions anti cheat is the only one which can actually detect ghost clients ( not talking about the shit ones ) , This is for the better of avicus and if any of this doesnt take place, I guess ill start revealing the players when I have time c; ( ill go nikeboom v2 on u ) .","body_tagged":"I have not played avicus for a shit on of time as it is not my \" main server\" I was thinking of moving to this server but then noticed something, The amount of un-legit players on avicus, ITS A SHIT TON and guess what, few of them are \" KNOWN \u0026nbsp;PLAYERS \" .
