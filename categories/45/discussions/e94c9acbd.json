It's much better for mods to just gather evidence, so that it's easier in appeals and to discuss with other moderators.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk thats enough ranting for now","created_at":"2017/08/25 10:22:38 +0000","created_at_human":"August 25, 2017 at 10:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":380048,"unique_id":"380048-2456","author":{"id":354547,"username":"BoldAndBrash","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5a0b55defddb448caf5070856cbf39ee?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"If we punished for debating points, you'd be banned by now.
