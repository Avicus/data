The people i was working with wanted the Minecraft Competitive scene to grow as a whole and not just on one server. Not going into too much detail, the first part of the plan was to provide players who are serious about competitive minecraft with opportunities, on all servers including Avicus. The best way of doing this was to create some kind of hub and provide events/opportunities for players.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSome of the guys have made a discord which will act as a hub for competitive players who want regular events on Avicus.
