To\r\nmy relief, a flickering light turned on revealing a box at my feet. I stared at\r\nit, confused. It was just a brown box smothered by duct tape, postage stamps\r\nand a plastic cover. I continued to just stare. I expected an ancient coffin\r\nwith strange words inscribed along the sides, encrusted in precious gems and\r\nfinished off with a delicate gloss. But no, it looked just like a parcel that\r\nfell out of the back of a truck. On the wall near it were 7 pairs of hooks\r\nnailed into the wall. The clothes that rested on the hooks were somewhat ripped\r\nand stained with blood as if the wearers were mauled by a pack of wolves. I\r\nswallowed the thought; this must have just been someone’s room before we moved\r\nhere. After all, this house was unoccupied for 8 years until we first moved in,\r\neverything here was worn down and out-dated.\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI bent down and ran my fingers along the top of the box, feeling for the\r\nopening. The smell of the cardboard delighted me in a way. I slowly peeled off\r\nthe tape and lifted one of the flaps, revealing what seemed to be an old\r\njournal containing 7 pages. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n“What are,” I paused “you.”\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI looked around the room. I could have sworn I heard someone’s voice. The air\r\nfelt thick but my curiosity was taking over, I couldn’t help it. The book lay\r\nin my hands, its pages stained and its cover torn. I flipped through the pages.\r\nEach paper looked like it had been ripped up then glued back together. I focus\r\nmy eyes on the smudged words.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ci\u003eDay 7\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI can’t escape. My sanity is draining.

I feel his cold hands covering\r\nmy face. His way of killing is strange, turning his victim into himself. The\r\nonly reason my parents couldn’t protect themselves.

An ear-piercing ringing starts, throwing\r\nme back into a wall. I fall on the floor releasing bloodcurdling screams from\r\nmy lips. It feels like a thousand pins are being inserted into my temple. My\r\nvision is distorted; the world feels like it’s breaking off beneath me. I grab\r\nthe piece of paper and start ripping it. The pieces lie on my lap and start to\r\nmove. They join together to form a new page. I kick the floor and reach out my\r\narms trying to drag myself towards the piece of paper. I hold it in my hands as words start to\r\nappear on the page. ‘\u003ci\u003eDay 8\u003c/i\u003e’ written\r\nat the top. Suddenly something grabs my arms and starts pulling towards a\r\ncorner. I scream for my parents, my arms flapping about trying to break free of\r\nthe thing grabbing me.

The darkness of the night reminds me that now it was my turn. I crawl\r\naway from my resting place and towards the book that rests peacefully in the\r\nopposite corner. I pick up a pen lying in the crease of the book. A fresh page\r\nlies before me, torn up and glued together. I start writing. Each word I print,\r\nthe closer I get to the next chapter. 8 long years ago I heard the moving van\r\npull into the driveway; the new voices of people chattering excitedly and the\r\nfootsteps on the storey above me, drawing me closer and closer towards this\r\nnight. I close the book and place it gently back inside the box. I drag my pale\r\nbody across the floor and rest against the wall, turning my head to see my\r\nparents’ clothes hanging on the 8th pair of hooks nailed into the\r\nwall next to me. I watch as my body slowly forms into a dark silhouette. I hear\r\nthe basement door creak open.

To\r\nmy relief, a flickering light turned on revealing a box at my feet. I stared at\r\nit, confused. It was just a brown box smothered by duct tape, postage stamps\r\nand a plastic cover.

To\r\nmy relief, a flickering light turned on revealing a box at my feet. I stared at\r\nit, confused. It was just a brown box smothered by duct tape, postage stamps\r\nand a plastic cover. I continued to just stare. I expected an ancient coffin\r\nwith strange words inscribed along the sides, encrusted in precious gems and\r\nfinished off with a delicate gloss. But no, it looked just like a parcel that\r\nfell out of the back of a truck. On the wall near it were 7 pairs of hooks\r\nnailed into the wall. The clothes that rested on the hooks were somewhat ripped\r\nand stained with blood as if the wearers were mauled by a pack of wolves. I\r\nswallowed the thought; this must have just been someone’s room before we moved\r\nhere. After all, this house was unoccupied for 8 years until we first moved in,\r\neverything here was worn down and out-dated.\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI bent down and ran my fingers along the top of the box, feeling for the\r\nopening. The smell of the cardboard delighted me in a way. I slowly peeled off\r\nthe tape and lifted one of the flaps, revealing what seemed to be an old\r\njournal containing 7 pages. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n“What are,” I paused “you.”\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI looked around the room. I could have sworn I heard someone’s voice. The air\r\nfelt thick but my curiosity was taking over, I couldn’t help it. The book lay\r\nin my hands, its pages stained and its cover torn. I flipped through the pages.\r\nEach paper looked like it had been ripped up then glued back together. I focus\r\nmy eyes on the smudged words.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ci\u003eDay 7\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI can’t escape. My sanity is draining. I can’t tell between reality and my\r\ndelusions. My hands are turning to stone; my eyes bloodshot and my bones are\r\nbrittle. He won’t leave. He follows me everywhere. I feel his cold hands covering\r\nmy face. His way of killing is strange, turning his victim into himself. The\r\nonly reason my parents couldn’t protect themselves. Now I’m stuck in a nightly\r\ncycle of suspense and an endless life of waiting for freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nI drop the paper, my hands frozen. As the paper floats to the ground it turns\r\nover, revealing more words.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ci\u003eHe will attack everyone who moves into\r\nthis house. You must leave immediately before it’s too late! You must leave\r\nnow! You must leave now! You must leave now!\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/i\u003eThe words replay inside my head. An ear-piercing ringing starts, throwing\r\nme back into a wall. I fall on the floor releasing bloodcurdling screams from\r\nmy lips. It feels like a thousand pins are being inserted into my temple. My\r\nvision is distorted; the world feels like it’s breaking off beneath me. I grab\r\nthe piece of paper and start ripping it. The pieces lie on my lap and start to\r\nmove. They join together to form a new page. I kick the floor and reach out my\r\narms trying to drag myself towards the piece of paper. I hold it in my hands as words start to\r\nappear on the page. ‘\u003ci\u003eDay 8\u003c/i\u003e’ written\r\nat the top. Suddenly something grabs my arms and starts pulling towards a\r\ncorner. I scream for my parents, my arms flapping about trying to break free of\r\nthe thing grabbing me. My head turns around as I see a towering shadow appear\r\nbehind me. \u003cbr\u003e\r\n“Who… Who are you?!” I scream\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe shadow man grins.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n“Don’t you remember little girl? You were just reading about me” \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\r\n\r\nI looked at my hands. Cold and heavy like solid rock. It was\r\ntime. The darkness of the night reminds me that now it was my turn. I crawl\r\naway from my resting place and towards the book that rests peacefully in the\r\nopposite corner. I pick up a pen lying in the crease of the book. A fresh page\r\nlies before me, torn up and glued together. I start writing. Each word I print,\r\nthe closer I get to the next chapter. 8 long years ago I heard the moving van\r\npull into the driveway; the new voices of people chattering excitedly and the\r\nfootsteps on the storey above me, drawing me closer and closer towards this\r\nnight. I close the book and place it gently back inside the box. I drag my pale\r\nbody across the floor and rest against the wall, turning my head to see my\r\nparents’ clothes hanging on the 8th pair of hooks nailed into the\r\nwall next to me. I watch as my body slowly forms into a dark silhouette. I hear\r\nthe basement door creak open.
