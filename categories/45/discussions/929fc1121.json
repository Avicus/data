OBS is one of the lightest if not the lightest screen recording software out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for other software heres my thoughts: Fraps and Dxtory are both really good and make good quality videos but make big file sizes. People also say it really lowers their FPS but I haven't noticed a huge fall in my FPS and you don't really need more than 60FPS. Camtasia is also pretty nice. I wouldn't recommend Action! because I had a lot of problems with it in the past with audio-video syncing and also just recording audio where it wouldn't record or wouldn't record properly.","created_at":"2015/07/14 18:23:41 +0000","created_at_human":"July 14, 2015 at  6:07 PM UTC"}},{"id":208294,"unique_id":"208294-600","author":{"id":442127,"username":"shahmi","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fc486af2733e44999724efdf53530550?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Loilo not that know but good I don't drop fps and that's what I use to record just need good settings","body_tagged":"Loilo not that know but good I don't drop fps and that's what I use to record just need good settings","created_at":"2015/07/15 04:20:40 +0000","created_at_human":"July 15, 2015 at  4:07 AM UTC"},{"id":209770,"unique_id":"209770-882","author":{"id":45327,"username":"OriginaI","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/00de9128b5904770aec2e85fb83aaf44?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cb\u003eUPDATE\u003cb\u003e: Got fraps and can record in 60 fps\u003cbr\u003eNow I need A good renderer\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cb\u003eUPDATE\u003cb\u003e: Got fraps and can record in 60 fps\u003cbr\u003eNow I need A good renderer\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e","created_at":"2015/07/20 13:55:40 +0000","created_at_human":"July 20, 2015 at  1:07 PM UTC"},{"id":209828,"unique_id":"209828-1097","author":{"id":45327,"username":"OriginaI","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/00de9128b5904770aec2e85fb83aaf44?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Bumping this","body_tagged":"Bumping this","created_at":"2015/07/20 17:34:52 +0000","created_at_human":"July 20, 2015 at  5:07 PM UTC"}]}
