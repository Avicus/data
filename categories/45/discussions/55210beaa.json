Tbh idk why I revamped it besides the fact I cringed hard when I found out Squiddie still uses it meanwhile I deleted it from my pack folder and stuck to using 32x packs. Idk how to do pack releases besides putting random screenshots showing off armor, items, particles and things that actually matter so here are the pictures. (Im trash at releasing packs which is why I dont do it often).
