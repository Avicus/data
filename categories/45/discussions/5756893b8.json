Okay, lets start with the positives. I really enjoy playing with you on hypixel and hanging when the old boys get in teamspeak to chat, its a fun time. I really liked you as a senior I thought you handled things great so major props. I disliked how you handled the pathetic situation. You didn't know anything about the situation and continued to argue against the victim and were not open to the other side of the argument.\u0026nbsp; Besides that one event, I'd consider you a friend.","created_at":"2017/09/06 02:57:59 +0000","created_at_human":"September  6, 2017 at  2:09 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":381030,"unique_id":"381030-4293","author":{"id":250406,"username":"Crazy_","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b3809e84c405fbfd0be15ec33ddcf76?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#D40000","staff":true},"body":"Opinion?","body_tagged":"Opinion?","created_at":"2017/09/05 05:46:41 +0000","created_at_human":"September  5, 2017 at  5:09 AM UTC"}},{"id":381087,"unique_id":"381087-4494","author":{"id":67153,"username":"XGalibur","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/a2fc436888a64ac1880da562d259b684?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Hi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan't wait for walls tourney!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions?","body_tagged":"Hi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan't wait for walls tourney!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions?","created_at":"2017/09/06 03:39:06 +0000","created_at_human":"September  6, 2017 at  3:09 AM UTC"},{"id":381088,"unique_id":"381088-229","author":{"id":1371,"username":"InputIGNHere","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6a81760ce56942099de44e6f636ab030?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"\u0026lt;input ama questions /\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eopinions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eam i cool\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhy am i typing like this?","body_tagged":"\u0026lt;input ama questions /\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eopinions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eam i cool\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhy am i typing like this?","created_at":"2017/09/06 03:42:24 +0000","created_at_human":"September  6, 2017 at  3:09 AM UTC"},{"id":381090,"unique_id":"381090-3167","author":{"id":2507,"username":"dev_revs","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/3feb57900603446c9bbfd5fb40759f41?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"Opinion (as a person and as a staff) ?
