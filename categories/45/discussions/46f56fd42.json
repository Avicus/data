I recently got banned about 4 months ago for ban evading after cussing in chat to get myself banned from the server. Only 1 or 2 of my true friends still played on the server at that time. I remember starting off as the kid who would always rage every time they die to getting pretty good at pvp. I feel like playing on this server really helped me to start getting into computer gaming and I have many fond memories of my friends and I playing on this server, but I feel like around the end of 7th grade I started feeling that Minecraft isn't the game for me because I am an extremely competitive person. So I recently moved onto CS:GO about 5 months ago. I just wanted to thank everyone on the server for what a wonderful 2.5 years it has been here (except the time my little sister's account got banned for ban evading). At the end of me playing Minecraft I was basically a total jerk, but now I have realized that and learned from it. Anyway if anyone wants to play something on steam with me my steam name is just ackataka and my Skype is also just ackataka. Anyway I really just wanted to say thank you for what a wonderful experience i have had on this server even before the name was changed to Avicus. This is my final goodbye to all players on the network; I wish you all well.","body_tagged":"Hey guys I have played on the network for 2.5 years and it feels like all of my friends have been leaving and Minecraft has been going downhill.
