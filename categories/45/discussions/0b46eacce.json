Mm..do you have more mods downloaded, except the ones you mentioned above? If so, take all of the mods out except one, then open minecraft. If it doesn't crash, add in one by one and open minecraft each time you do so. That way, you can see what is causing your minecraft to crash. But, if you only have those two mods, check if they are compatible with one another. If it still crashes, let me know, I will test it out myself :D Best of luck Samuel!","body_tagged":"I had the same experience with mods.
