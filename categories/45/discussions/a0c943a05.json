A couple of weeks ago, I was cleaning my room and I found my 10-year old HP Pavilion. I was going to throw it away but I decided to upgrade it a little bit with a few used parts from eBay. At this point, almost anything was considered an upgrade to this 10-year old dinosaur.

I bought the power supply on Amazon, I didn't want to cheap out on the most important component. I bought the graphics card (NVIDIA Geforce GT 620) during the EVGA Memorial Weekend Sale (only thing I bought on sale). I found an Intel processor on ebay as well as a decent Gygabite motherboard to go along with it. Everything else was basic stuff such as CPU cooler, thermal paste and some adapters (the hard drive and DVD drives were so old that the new motherboard didn't support them without adapters). The only parts I kept from the original build are the case, keyboard, monitor,DVD/CD drives and a 40 GB (Yes 40 GB) hard drive. I used my old Razer Abyssus gaming mouse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as actual building goes, I had to replace the I/O shield so it would fit the new motherboard and I had a bit of trouble taking the old one off, it was well secured so I had to use a couple of flat-head screwdrivers.
