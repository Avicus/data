So in my school all the teachers are old af, but our history teacher is young and my classmates always make jokes about how hot she is and some other stuff I won't write in that post (I think you can understand yourself xd). So one time after the lesson ended and the next lesson was history, the teacher didn't come, so me and my friend decided to go to the first floor to ask the head teacher if we have the lesson, while going down the stairs I fell and my head was stuck right in the history's teacher breast, I did not understand where I am and I started shaking my head, and my friend was laughing. Oh god, so awkward.","created_at":"2016/01/02 20:16:48 +0000","created_at_human":"January  2, 2016 at  8:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":266208,"unique_id":"266208-4106","author":{"id":67653,"username":"Pavlo","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05ac132fd359c05484a302d102972624?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"My thoughts exactly O.o","body_tagged":"My thoughts exactly O.o","created_at":"2016/01/02 23:58:09 +0000","created_at_human":"January  2, 2016 at 11:01 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":265985,"unique_id":"265985-297","author":{"id":354547,"username":"BoldAndBrash","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5a0b55defddb448caf5070856cbf39ee?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"You were drunk at the age 13?
