It makes sense since there are only 13 episodes. That's what I thought the problem was. The whole story was mushed into just 13 episodes. The anime really never explained how everyone died; only Yuri, Iwasawa, Otanashi, and we can assume how Yui died. What I would love is if they made some sort of movie that explained how each member of the Battlefront died.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, so I'm not the type of person that cries a lot. In fact, I haven't cried in years. But when I saw the end of Angel Beats!, I just had to. The whole thing had just touched me, thinking that all of them were just people who weren't able to accomplish something in their real life and died with regrets. The part that made me cry was the graduation part. I did have a sad feeling when Iwasawa and Yui both passed on. And I felt soooo bad when Kanade left Otanashi. Thats the part that totally ripped me apart. Otanashi's heart was donated to Kanade! It made me feel so sad that when Kanade left because her whole purpose in that world was to thank Otanashi. When she did leave, Otanashi screamed out because she left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard Clannad was sadder, so I know it will be good. Now I have something to look forward to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eDeath Note Episode 1\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI had a first bad impression on this anime, mostly on the intro. I just thought it was freaking creepy.

They arent friends anymore, but I think they will be in later episodes because their friendship only lasted a day. And as shown in the intro, Sinon is a pretty big character in the whole plot.

It makes sense since there are only 13 episodes. That's what I thought the problem was. The whole story was mushed into just 13 episodes. The anime really never explained how everyone died; only Yuri, Iwasawa, Otanashi, and we can assume how Yui died. What I would love is if they made some sort of movie that explained how each member of the Battlefront died.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, so I'm not the type of person that cries a lot. In fact, I haven't cried in years. But when I saw the end of Angel Beats!, I just had to. The whole thing had just touched me, thinking that all of them were just people who weren't able to accomplish something in their real life and died with regrets. The part that made me cry was the graduation part. I did have a sad feeling when Iwasawa and Yui both passed on. And I felt soooo bad when Kanade left Otanashi. Thats the part that totally ripped me apart. Otanashi's heart was donated to Kanade! It made me feel so sad that when Kanade left because her whole purpose in that world was to thank Otanashi. When she did leave, Otanashi screamed out because she left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard Clannad was sadder, so I know it will be good.

I t had potential with a suckish plot. I mean, when i read the sypnosis, i was like \u0026nbsp;\"wow i wanna watch this\" but i didnt like it towards the end due to ALO and the plot is going all over the place. First its about Kirito, then Asuna, and now Yukki? I thought Asuna was cool. I wanted her to be that typical tsudere girl but she broke character which i don like :(. Shes so girly now and ya. I would give this a 8.7/10 if\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey used the 50 episodes to actually go more indepth in the Aincrad Saga, skip AlO, add GGO and Sinion, Sinion dates Kirito, and then ALO with out Yukki in the end. Like i thought it was pretty unneccsary. (Btw, i did not have any feels in the last episode when Yukki died becuz i was pretty mad when Yukki was the best swordsman) So ya, could have been better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#KiritoxSinon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAkame Ga Kill: 7.8/10-\u003c/b\u003e Again, this anime had potential. I would have rated it 9/10 but when the anime did not correspond with the manga and everyone started dieing, i was like -_-. seriously?!?!?! Well, i gave it a .8 because the plot was outstanding, battle was epic and the last fight with Akame vs Esdeth was pretty sweet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmagi Brilliant Park: 8/10-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThis anime is actually not bad. I mean its good to relax after you watched a big anime series. It was pretty funny with jokes here and there. One thing i didnt like in particular was Kaine and Sento. Like I wanted a bit of romance in the series which there was but it didnt feel complete. If this actually went to be a romance, i would have rated it a 9/10. Pretty good anime so i recommend but the ending is sort of, lacklustering or anti climatic\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Pet Girl at Sakaurasou: 9.2/10-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThis anime, a funny comedic, slice of life with romance was really good and I totally recommend this to everybody. It starts off where this one normal guy lives in a special dorm for kids who have talented abilities but most are crazy. Things changed when a girl named Mashorin appeard. A talented artist, things began to change at Sakurasou. This anime kept me hooked with all the jokes and the plot is amazing.
