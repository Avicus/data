After a while, he was banned. Then, came someone named CaptainTigerman2. Although I am unsure whether this was an alt or his brother's account, he did the same thing that tigerman20 did, only a bit less intense, thus allowing him to cling on without being banned for a while. Then, the Tigerman Family came, and they bonded together to try to destroy Avicus. I'm not sure exactly who all was in it, but there were a couple who spammed the forums with....errr....gifs. Another was a guy called FightToFight, who wasn't a huge offender for a while, but he was still mean, and was eventually banned.\u003cbr\u003eAfter all of the family was banned. (I'm not sure whether or not fishyfacediamond was in it, but I think she was at one time. She is not banned, and is a good member of our community today.) We didn't hear of them for around a couple months. Then, tigerman poped up on OCN. Yes, he tried to actually give them Nexus for them to use. OCN, not born yesterday, immediately rejected this idea. CaptainTigerman2 also popped up there, but he didn't really do much to my knowledge. Then, after about a month, a forum member (I think was fishyfacediamond.) received a tweet telling him/her that he has a little something to destroy Avicus. Although Avicus did go down for a little bit, it was never called out to be a DDoS attack, and is assumed to be regular downtime.\u003cbr\u003eSo, that is the story of tigerman so far.","created_at":"2014/06/29 13:28:11 +0000","created_at_human":"June 29, 2014 at  1:06 PM UTC"}},{"id":28391,"unique_id":"28391-4761","author":{"id":72,"username":"NewVoltdrive","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/ea281241b13a4f85b6e99ef389091693?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Ok, but he did join the Tigerman Family.
