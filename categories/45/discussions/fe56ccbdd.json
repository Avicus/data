The thing is I dont really mean that, And im sorry if you dont like my post on the fourms cause nobody really reads them :/... Ok when I first started playing minecraft one of the first servers I knew was a kit pvp server (Only 20 people on TOPS), I suddenly got very interested in pvp so started playing that ALOT. I played so much\u0026nbsp; they banned me for hacking because my arrow would almost always hit them even from across the map, the person that banned me said the console said I was hacking, But I showed him proof on skype and finally got unbanned, On the scoreboard I was the underdog, nobody really heard of me and I was slowly making my way up, finally I was in the top 2 It was me vs. the owner, As I played a ton he couldnt really match up to me cause he is in high school, I finally got over 2000 kills and \u003cb\u003e×\u003c/b\u003e4 his amount of kills, sadly as almost no people logged anymore he closed it down :( This forced me to go to another server, This meant more people, and better pvp skills, One of them I had to get checked for hacking again, But the people were wayyyyy better so I could barely get a kill, when I did I wanted to show everyone by saying stuff like that, Now its now, I need to change cause I have a small little youtube channel going (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrr220g5TwPq6bKDJZCVXLg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrr220g5TwPq6bKDJZCVXLg\u003c/a\u003e), and im way better at pvp, the reason I only really do this is only when they start doing it to me or saying I suck. But for everybody, I will be changing, I will not be cocky, rude, and I will try not to post so much things on the fourms :/\u0026nbsp; This has been a amazing journey with you guys and will not hopefully be leaving any time soon. And some people might not of seen my other side of which I am rude, I actually only do this like 1 time a day, Now it will be 0 times a day.
