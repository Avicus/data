Are you serious? $200 is a lot... Rich boy. Plus the i7 4930k or whatever, is not needed at all, stop bragging, doubt you even have one. And $1000 for a gaming PC, that will just run like ~500 fps? How about a PC that costs 700 or something, and can run MC at ~500 fps with SHADERS. Idk why you even would go for the i7 4930k, unless you're rendering.","created_at":"2015/03/05 02:56:39 +0000","created_at_human":"March  5, 2015 at  2:03 AM UTC"}},{"id":161117,"unique_id":"161117-3276","author":{"id":347312,"username":"_Phyre","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40d193e564da54887a49bb1cc7e65dc6?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Omg... the 4790k isnt more diffirent then a regular i5-4690k...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the i5 beats most i7 CPU's\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ I do make money too, so don't act like you're all fancy and earn money by going on vacation...","body_tagged":"Omg... the 4790k isnt more diffirent then a regular i5-4690k...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the i5 beats most i7 CPU's\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ I do make money too, so don't act like you're all fancy and earn money by going on vacation...","created_at":"2015/03/05 16:27:30 +0000","created_at_human":"March  5, 2015 at  4:03 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":161114,"unique_id":"161114-3700","author":{"id":82,"username":"BelgiumWaffles","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/1dc76351716f4bb29c6390223cff3dde?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I am not rich i work really hard for my money but i am sure u dont know what working is u Jelly kid and its THE i7 4790k\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethe i7 4930k is An 6 core my brother owns one of these\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand for me 200 euro is not that much i go work every weekend and every vacation and each day i get 55 euro so its not that much for me","body_tagged":"I am not rich i work really hard for my money but i am sure u dont know what working is u Jelly kid and its THE i7 4790k\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethe i7 4930k is An 6 core my brother owns one of these\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand for me 200 euro is not that much i go work every weekend and every vacation and each day i get 55 euro so its not that much for me","created_at":"2015/03/05 16:22:04 +0000","created_at_human":"March  5, 2015 at  4:03 PM UTC"}},{"id":161118,"unique_id":"161118-4725","author":{"id":82,"username":"BelgiumWaffles","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/1dc76351716f4bb29c6390223cff3dde?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I dont go on an vacation u troll i work","body_tagged":"I dont go on an vacation u troll i work","created_at":"2015/03/05 16:31:35 +0000","created_at_human":"March  5, 2015 at  4:03 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":161117,"unique_id":"161117-3432","author":{"id":347312,"username":"_Phyre","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40d193e564da54887a49bb1cc7e65dc6?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Omg... the 4790k isnt more diffirent then a regular i5-4690k...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the i5 beats most i7 CPU's\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ I do make money too, so don't act like you're all fancy and earn money by going on vacation...","body_tagged":"Omg... the 4790k isnt more diffirent then a regular i5-4690k...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the i5 beats most i7 CPU's\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+ I do make money too, so don't act like you're all fancy and earn money by going on vacation...","created_at":"2015/03/05 16:27:30 +0000","created_at_human":"March  5, 2015 at  4:03 PM UTC"}},{"id":161122,"unique_id":"161122-1375","author":{"id":330003,"username":"Stimulating","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/779b7f782ecf4da790babb43fb608796?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"You can make Windows believe it's a legit copy of Windows if done correctly, which doesn't lock up registry or hinder preformance.
