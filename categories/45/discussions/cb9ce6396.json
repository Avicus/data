This is very frustrating and since no one answers my appeals or my sky messages I'm leaving it out here for anyone to see how bad you guys have been treeating me. I planned on taking this server seriously and bringing a different community of people since I have many contacts but if this keeps happening, I wont even be able to play on the server.
