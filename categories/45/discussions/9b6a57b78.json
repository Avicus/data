I was appealed around 10 days later after discussing it with Pel. I don’t want to rant on pathetically but I’ll cut it short: after my demotion I was continuously asked by players why and I said “I had an argument with Para” and one time I mentioned one of the topics, which some thought was a step too far. The other reason was that I linked two users a Junior Mod review sheet from early 2014 which I was given by Zeus.

I would say I’m quite well known within both the community and staff team, and I enjoy connecting with both parties.

Nothing is more important than the player body and if that means leaving a competitive match then so be it.

If they’re being unresponsive then I’d kick them, then a 10 minute ban. If they return then either a sticky or extended ban would be necessary.\r\n        \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n        \u003cbr\u003e\r\n        \u003cu\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n            A player has been banned in-game is constantly posting on his/her appeal.

I’d make it dead clear that the senior staff team are extremely busy and you should have patience.

All three of my surveys have had over 20 replies and each have (hopefully) had an impact on future decisions.\r\n        \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n      \u003c/b\u003e\r\n    \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n    \u003ch2\u003e\r\n      \u003cb\u003e\r\n        Criteria 2 - General Situations\r\n      \u003c/b\u003e\r\n    \u003c/h2\u003e\r\n    \u003cbr\u003e\r\n    \u003ch4\u003e\r\n      \u003cb\u003e\r\n        \u003cu\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n            Many reports are coming in regarding a player harassing others. You are in a scrimmage and close to winning the match, but you are the only staff member on. How would you handle the situation?\r\n          \u003c/h3\u003e\r\n        \u003c/u\u003e\r\n        \u003ch4\u003e\r\n          Now I’m sure you’re aware I’m in Apollo and when I used to be staff I would always make sure there was at least two moderators that weren’t scrimming, and that meant I had to not play sometimes. Nothing is more important than the player body and if that means leaving a competitive match then so be it. Reports always come first.\r\n        \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n        \u003cbr\u003e\r\n        \u003cu\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n            A group of players are repeatedly joining the support room channels on TeamSpeak to troll, you are the only staff member online, what do you do?\r\n          \u003c/h3\u003e\r\n        \u003c/u\u003e\r\n        \u003ch4\u003e\r\n          Well firstly I’d @here in the Slack channel just to get support if needed to punish, next I’d proceed to attempt to talk to them, getting the basic information. If they’re being unresponsive then I’d kick them, then a 10 minute ban. If they return then either a sticky or extended ban would be necessary.\r\n        \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n        \u003cbr\u003e\r\n        \u003cu\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n            A player has been banned in-game is constantly posting on his/her appeal. No staff member has replied to these posts in 3 days, but as a Junior Moderator, you are not allowed to make a decision on the situation. How would you handle this?\r\n          \u003c/h3\u003e\r\n        \u003c/u\u003e\r\n        \u003ch4\u003e\r\n          I’d put aside the actual appeal and reply to the thread stating that constantly bumping will not aid their appeal and chances of success will be less. I’d make it dead clear that the senior staff team are extremely busy and you should have patience. If they reply to my post then I’d take it to Skype.\r\n        \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n        \u003cbr\u003e\r\n        \u003cu\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n            Do you have access to TeamSpeak?

I would like to admit to my mistakes and arrogant, defensive attitude towards a number of individuals in the senior staff. I’ve learnt that I was wrong and shouldn’t have acted the way I did. Recently I’ve attempted to redeem myself by giving feedback on several matters to both admins and a few days ago I contacted John and Sli. I hope past incidents can be put aside as I have lots of ideas I want to share woud like to give as much detailed feedback as possible.\r\n        \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n      \u003c/b\u003e\r\n    \u003c/h4\u003e\r\n    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n    \u003ch3\u003e\r\n      \u003ccenter\u003e\r\n        \u003cb\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n            Thank you so much for reading this and hope you have a great day!\r\n          \u003ch3\u003e\r\n          \u003ch4\u003e\r\n            Appreciation to resepignev on HTML help!
