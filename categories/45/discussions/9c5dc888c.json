Me and Ephesians had a bet that would lead to the destruction of the multiverse! It would lead chaos to the world and destroy all timelines. What was this crazy bet? Hmm? Well, there was this walls game. There were 4 players remaining, and I chose a player named RedFridge007 and Ephesians chose Illusion_Master. Yes they are real people, I have screenshots :o. If the player I chose won, She would have to say Clickn Is Godly, if her player won, I would have to sa the same, So,\u0026nbsp;After a long time, it was only those 2 players left, Illusion_Master was stacked and RedFridge007 only had a small skyblock he had made. Illusion_Master came up and RedFridge007 lit him up on fire and Illusion_Master missed alot! In the end.
