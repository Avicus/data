I am a good pvper in the server, and I have seen some great players that are better than me in pvp in this server. I was banned, because he/she said that I was hacking, using aimbot. I have been playing this server for about 2 years now. My username before I bought a new one was called Stevenkyu. Some might know, but I don't think you might know my name because I don't really have a friend on my own in this server, and I am just a solo-player. I have seen a lot of incident throughout my years, and this was really disappointing. This was one my favorite server, and I just can't believe what had happened. To explain this, I would tell you. I was playing on Nebula, on the map called... I don't really remember the name, but the teams are called duck and turkey I guess. I was really doing well on that time, because the players were quite ''nooby'', and I could easily kill them. I am a good pvper, and I was enjoying my time. But then.. my screen got blocked and said that I was banned for aimbot. I was just shocked in my eyes what I have just saw. I sent emails to the staff to say that I wasn't hacking and I was innocent, but all they say was '' Sorry our staff is 100% sure before they ban people. And it seems like your appeal is denied''. It was not an appeal. I couldn't prove my innocence because I don't even know how, because that happened so suddenly, and so much quickly. And even though how many emails I sent to them, the answers were all same. I told them to test me again, bring the mod who banned me to see me pvping again, to prove my innocence, but they will just ignore me and say that my appeal was denied. I would like to tell the community that this should be known, that staff are just listening to themselves, and not listening to their costumers. They are not even trying to see what I am talking about. They just listen to their people and what they say.. I know this is life but this is not not fair to the people are get banned for no reason. To all players on this server, please.. help me..","body_tagged":"I am writing this to the whole community because of a incident happened to me about 3 weeks ago.
