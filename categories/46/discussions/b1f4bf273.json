Nice motherboard, can't really go much cheaper without sacrificing some good features, and does not clash with your themed build. 8 GB of RAM since you won't need more and is also white. The power supply is the one thing I had to go a little off plan because I wanted something that was modular so the ketchup and mustard cables didn't clash with the white theme, but was unable to because of heavy prices on them.

The power supply is the one thing I had to go a little off plan because I wanted something that was modular so the ketchup and mustard cables didn't clash with the white theme, but was unable to because of heavy prices on them. You could always put someone mesh or paper over the cables though, and it would still look alright. Overall I'm pretty proud with this build and I can safely guarantee you a lag free experience.

Has an i7 4790K paired with a GTX 980. 120 GB SSD and a 1 TB WD HDD, still the best value storage pair in my opinion. Also has a white case from NZXT (I recommend getting LEDs to make it look a lot cooler). Has an air cooler, since I don't think you'd need to overclock. If you want extra performance in the future instead of upgrading just get a good water cooler and overclock. Made space for the headset I recommend the most, and since you wanted a white build the HyperX Cloud was an amazing choice as it looks incredible in white and black, has great sound and build quality as well as comfort. The microphone is detachable and is very good for Skype or TS, but I would get a separate microphone for recording or live streaming. Nice motherboard, can't really go much cheaper without sacrificing some good features, and does not clash with your themed build. 8 GB of RAM since you won't need more and is also white.
