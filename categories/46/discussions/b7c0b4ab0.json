However those who did join in game me some info on why they did not enjoy Elimination as much as other gametypes, some of this includes: Prolonged games due to hunting, mining, or searching for items. This is why i feel Elimination needs a boost or more loving to create a player base that will return for more once a game ends. Calling all Mods! please take some time to talk about the revamping of Elimination!","body_tagged":"As you have seen before i posted a thread telling anyone who was interested to join in on a game of Elimination, sadly not that many people were interested.
