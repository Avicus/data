So if people arent on other servers you can just go on the creative server and make your own plot. Another thing you could make a game call master builders its where every person is in a plot of their own they cant see anyone elses but there own and you give them something to build and then after 4 minutes is up you have every one rate each others creations with different stained glass, i hope you take this idea into consideration\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. the reason why im suggesting this is because i have gone on this server and their arent enough people to play, i want to play on this server but their isnt enough people so you should make creative cause any one could be on","body_tagged":"hello, My name is thebrosknows i have been playing avicus for a really long time but i just got an avicus acount so what my idea was maybe you guys can think about actually having creative as one of your games.
