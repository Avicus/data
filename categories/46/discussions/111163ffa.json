If you are unaware they have recently released a hint that 1.9 will focus on combat mechanics, and it seems like they will be working on these and changing them a fair bit. I personally hope they revert to something similar of 1.7 but they could even completely change the system via a perry, dodge and crit system. Either way, It's bound to upset a lot of people no matter the outcome, who knows, they may even add new items!
