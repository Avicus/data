I need this as the case isn't that big, I'm unsure of the wattage and isn't cooled great (but is still good value as the equivalent parts would cost me about 500 AUD). Would this be any good for GTA V, MKX, TF2, FO:4 and MC? I'm not used to great performance (lowest settings 30 fps on MC for 2-3 years :P) but I would enjoy playing med-hi on GTAV and MKX. I'm excited for fallout 4 but unsure about specs and MC/TF2 are very low requirement games.","body_tagged":"I'm posting this here as I don't know any other good, online forums that have a clue about tech related stuff and although I've been gone for ages I still trust your advice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecs:\u003cbr\u003eQuad-Core i5-2400 @ 3.1Ghz\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e8gb ddr3 1300Mhz ram\u003cbr\u003e250GB 7200RPM HDD\u003cbr\u003eGTX 750ti\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e(unsure of other parts as I'm buying it used online)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I am doing is buying and old Lenovo M81 (for 350 AUD) and adding a GTX 750ti, I chose this card as it is small, quiet and low power consumption.
