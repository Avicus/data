The reason for this is because Ive always doubted Razer, because they have a bad reputaion of being overrated, so thats why I take extreme caution before buying them. They have extremely cool looking products, so thats why I always take a look at them, in the rare case that they have a good product, like this headset (possibly) or the DeathAdder, or the DeathStalker (its overpriced but its amazing and looks godly for a membrane). Sorry if I ramble too much, I just need to know =P.","created_at":"2015/08/05 23:21:05 +0000","created_at_human":"August  5, 2015 at 11:08 PM UTC"}},{"id":216074,"unique_id":"216074-3258","author":{"id":314780,"username":"hippitydippity","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/877536c90760477a95e183ba1e5a4696?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cfont size=\"2\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca title=\"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD-M1F6L4g\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD-M1F6L4g\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD-M1F6L4g\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooks vs performance, your decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/font\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cfont size=\"2\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca title=\"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD-M1F6L4g\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD-M1F6L4g\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD-M1F6L4g\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooks vs performance, your decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/font\u003e","created_at":"2015/08/06 08:33:47 +0000","created_at_human":"August  6, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC"},{"id":216131,"unique_id":"216131-1277","author":{"id":265660,"username":"Spartemex","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/a497e5e9d8d84b509d0d0646134866b8?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kingston.com/us/hyperx/cloud#hscp\"\u003eKingston HyperX Cloud II\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReviews:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.maximumpc.com/kingston-launches-updated-hyperx-cloud-ii-headset-2015/\"\u003ehttp://www.maximumpc.com/kingston-launches-updated-hyperx-cloud-ii-headset-2015/\u003c/a\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kingston.com/us/hyperx/cloud#hscp\"\u003eKingston HyperX Cloud II\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReviews:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.maximumpc.com/kingston-launches-updated-hyperx-cloud-ii-headset-2015/\"\u003ehttp://www.maximumpc.com/kingston-launches-updated-hyperx-cloud-ii-headset-2015/\u003c/a\u003e","created_at":"2015/08/06 14:32:33 +0000","created_at_human":"August  6, 2015 at  2:08 PM UTC"},{"id":216143,"unique_id":"216143-3754","author":{"id":5141,"username":"Sevoo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/0f2408c6b4554076a115d9ea6c81a335?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"So basically, I just took a look at the Cloud 2 and loved the headset itself, but the look sucks.
