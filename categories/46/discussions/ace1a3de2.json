My computer is a Dell® vostro 200 from 2007. My computer is really crappy and I'm thinking of just upgrading it's parts then buying a new one. I have considered buying graphic cards from AMD because they are meant for gaming but I can't find any that fit in my price range. I looked at the AMD RaedonHD7770 but it costed $150. So yeah I was just wondering what in your mind is the best graphic card which is in the price range of $100.\u0026nbsp;","body_tagged":"My computer is running slow so I'm thinking of upgrading it's parts, I was just wondering in your guys opinions what kind of graphics card I should get.
