My time to shine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrafing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou need to run around your opponent whilst fighting them, otherwise they will get more combos on you. Try and jump as much as you can whilst hitting them to get critical hits. (This works best when you have a better ping)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlockhitting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite, to do this click left and right as much as possible and you will block hit (It works in 1.8 but doesn't show up) This allows you to take less damage as well as hit the opponent. Do this whilst jumping.

This takes practice but it is great to learn. Breezily bridging, just walking backwards and placing blocks to bridge, but you do not hold shift.
