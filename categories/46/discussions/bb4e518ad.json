That is possible, there are servers that do that.","created_at":"2015/04/04 16:52:26 +0000","created_at_human":"April  4, 2015 at  4:04 PM UTC"}},{"id":172134,"unique_id":"172134-342","author":{"id":356114,"username":"Alpapi","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b67d68a5d90c4343aa885c19f28b81d7?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I'm fine with using 1.8 on servers.
