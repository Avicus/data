They've made a commitment to the rest of you players out there to help you and make the servers a better place. So they get angry at you for a petty reason, whoopdee do, they also banned that fly hacked a minute ago and that kill aura kid that was shredding your precious kd.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo can you stop just focusing on the negatives. \"Snow kicked me for something stupid = Bad mod?\" what about the 3 hours Snow's been doing nothing but server hopping to spectate ppl who've been reported. And maybe 10 or so hackers he's banned, and the 10 ppl he's told to calm down and maybe theres a bug on one of the servers he's trying to fix. I'm not seeing you creating a topic over all the good things.","created_at":"2015/08/08 01:29:10 +0000","created_at_human":"August  8, 2015 at  1:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":216666,"unique_id":"216666-1583","author":{"id":314633,"username":"jracer15","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/beff39f4044d4c62a333c65e90555e70?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"It seems your infractions involve hating on the staff. \u0026nbsp;Maybe just play the game and not talk about them?

It was just a simple question and I was just agreeing with other players. This is what i mean. People make situations into a big deal. Including myself. Yes like I did right now. But people do really need to control the way they look toward things. Including staff. Also we need to be less bias on choosing sides when a staff is trying to punish a player. The staff should at least give a warning first. Not an automatic kick. That is unbelievable. Maybe the player may take it into consideration if the staff was at least trying to comply with the player. For example, Say if the player were trying to block the entrance to something\u003cb\u003e important.\u003c/b\u003e The staff saw what the player and just kicked him. At least let the player explain why he or she blocked the entrance to the important thing. In addition, staff need to stop \u003cb\u003eassuming\u003c/b\u003e things and let players explain the situation and then the staff and player can work things out. This will dramatically increase the respect of a player to a staff. It would also help people in life to make better decisions and not do them again. If the staff and player were to \u003cb\u003ecomply\u003c/b\u003e together there would no conflict and peace. This is a really important message.
