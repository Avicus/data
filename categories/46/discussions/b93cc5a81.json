Its a very fun, tactical team/teamwork based FPS game that is being played professionally by pro teams at a tournament now with a prize pool of $250,000(usd i believe).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo any way, i was just wonering if anyone else played it? To you play MatchMaking comp? What is your *rank? And are you interested in playing with me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The CSGO ranking system is extremely important to me, as i think we need people of a similiar skill level, as apose to one person that carries the team, or one person that is a bit slow on the calls, rotates ect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emy current rank is only Silver Elite Master so i am looking for people of roughly Silver Elile/Gold Nova 1. If you have absloutly no idea what i am talking about, go to your web browser of choice and type into the images section \"CS:GO Ranks\", and that should give you a rough idea of what to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, then i began to wonder if Avicus could have a CS:GO team, or if that was too big of a dream... We would just need basically the Avicus Logo as a picture thingy and possibly a TeamSpeak server...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf anyone is interested please respond here, or if you need any more information/help please...
