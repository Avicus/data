The story is very interesting and you get so immersed in the world. It has the original Telltale feel, but it adds new game play mechanics that make Minecraft, well, Minecraft. It has its own crafting and combat system and hilarious time-lapses of the characters constructing buildings. The graphics look really nice, if that even matters. The voices are great as always. Like I mentioned before, the story/plot is so unique that it'll have me thinking about it for hours. I have to admit, this is the first Telltale game I've bought/played (I've watched playthoughs of all of the other games) and I was definitely\u0026nbsp;not disappointed. If you still think this game is lame, well, it's your loss. Highly recommend it!","body_tagged":"So yeah, I just finished playing episode 1... and I agree with Vlad.
