And if you had to pick a position, people could pick the position that gives the most credits, yet not serve the position they chose.\u003cbr\u003eAlso I usually switch around, depending on how well the defense is holding up. I know many other people do this as well, so being stuck in one position could be harmful to your team.","created_at":"2016/02/17 01:36:09 +0000","created_at_human":"February 17, 2016 at  1:02 AM UTC"}},{"id":280033,"unique_id":"280033-4555","author":{"id":132462,"username":"TechnoEagle","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/8cae7fdf0f9f4cb6869c52b7f7dc1b69?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"yeah you should get credits for def im good at def and thats a good idea","body_tagged":"yeah you should get credits for def im good at def and thats a good idea","created_at":"2016/02/17 16:39:58 +0000","created_at_human":"February 17, 2016 at  4:02 PM UTC"},{"id":280038,"unique_id":"280038-208","author":{"id":442127,"username":"shahmi","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fc486af2733e44999724efdf53530550?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Yeah that could work but if the devs want to make it complex my idea isn't that bad","body_tagged":"Yeah that could work but if the devs want to make it complex my idea isn't that bad","created_at":"2016/02/17 17:03:23 +0000","created_at_human":"February 17, 2016 at  5:02 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":280026,"unique_id":"280026-1235","author":{"id":6564,"username":"kycrafft","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bcefeeb60e1af497aa9a36dacbc965?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"That's a bit complex.
