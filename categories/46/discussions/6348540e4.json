When you get 11 achievements with Engineer, you get \"the gunslinger\" which allows you to build a mini sentry, and it's probably one of the best engineer items. Besides that, I would use the wrangler since it allows you to take control of your sentry gun, and you can shoot much farther than when the sentry is shooting by itself. For the main weapon I would use the widowmaker (very easy to obtain) since it uses metal as ammo, and you also gain ammo every time you hit an enemy.
