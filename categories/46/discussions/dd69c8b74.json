GoG was the first tournament that ninja bridging was attempted and it was by either Badlion or Starfish. When it was done it was fast...for what it was. The Ocn community knew about this bridging for two more tournaments before Shroom did that. Take Varis Hawk for example. Varis is the fastest person to do a spread, but he didn't make it. There are also rumors that Badlion could of done that type of bridging if they lasted longer then GoG.","created_at":"2015/04/15 20:11:58 +0000","created_at_human":"April 15, 2015 at  8:04 PM UTC"}},{"id":177565,"unique_id":"177565-2355","author":{"id":388668,"username":"NotGurk","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7c69cb9f638d4cdbbc432df60b09e6d3?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Only peasants ninja bridge!\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs\" title=\"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdit: Didn't realize you were talking about staircases, in which case the best way is to bind placing blocks on your left mouse button and jitter clicking while jumping and pressing s in small coordinated taps, don't hold it otherwise you'll die","body_tagged":"Only peasants ninja bridge!\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs\" title=\"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdit: Didn't realize you were talking about staircases, in which case the best way is to bind placing blocks on your left mouse button and jitter clicking while jumping and pressing s in small coordinated taps, don't hold it otherwise you'll die","created_at":"2015/04/15 20:47:27 +0000","created_at_human":"April 15, 2015 at  8:04 PM UTC"},{"id":177570,"unique_id":"177570-2560","author":{"id":108,"username":"MLGtino","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5855cb2b462f42969c1e685db0ecd987?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I haven't tried it in 1.8.

before placing a block. Immediately after releasing shift, press down space for a tiny amount of time, just enough for you to place a block while jumping up once. Then, let go of space and press down shift again.
