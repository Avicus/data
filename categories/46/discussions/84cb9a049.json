I've been playing it a lot for the past 4 days, and if you don't know what it is, it's a combat game oriented around eggs. Though there are premium perks, they did a pretty fantastic job balancing everything and it's super fun, so I'd recommend registering and playing some 1v1 matches against other lower levels to build up your XP. Very customizable too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get higher levels, you participate in matches and kill people. It's very strategical and there's quite a few maps to try out. I got hooked on it and also would like to know if there's any bad eggs players on here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don't want to register but still try it, you can play as a guest but nothing will save.
