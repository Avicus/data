Astralis vs. VP game was super close. Overpass: 17-19. Train: 15-19. I was scared because I bet on VP and I didn't think Astralis would be able to get anywhere with 2 stand-ins. Even though zonic didn't have the fragging power, they still made it work. Gla1ve is just a GOD. Was a very exciting match.","body_tagged":"Damn. Astralis vs. VP game was super close.
