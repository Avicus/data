I'd love to use it however it never has any players, and I'm reluctant to wait in the survival games lobby until it gathers the players and I'm sure all of you guys feel the same way. Give me a +1 if you'd like to see survival games become more active and post suggestions as to how we or the mods can fix the current inactivity. Thanks guys.","body_tagged":"Does anyone else feel like they would play survival games if it was more active?
