The email that you register with for your forum account is the one that\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eyou must register\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;with when registering for an Alpha account. This allows us to filter out those who create multiple accounts :(. The only way that this could be bypassed is if you create multiple forum accounts, each having a different email, if that's ever going to be the case, you will be banned from the forum and from the Alpha test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003eThe account page overall is about 80% done, and most of its features work perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003etl;dr\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegistering\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e1) Visit\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://cubition.net/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 136, 204); text-decoration: none;\"\u003ehttp://cubition.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e2) Create an account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e3) Confirm your email\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e4) Login to your forum account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e5) Hit the\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eAccount\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;tab on the navbar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou should be directed to\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://auth.cubition.net/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 136, 204); text-decoration: none;\"\u003ehttp://auth.cubition.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e6) Hit the\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eRegister\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;button at the top right\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e7) Fill out this form:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.gyazo.com/f64a5d52dac82017f8678b375df2a213.png\" alt=\"Registration Page\" style=\"height: auto; max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px;\" title=\"Image: http://i.gyazo.com/f64a5d52dac82017f8678b375df2a213.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e8) Hit register\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003e9) You should be logged in, if not hit the\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eLogin\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;button and login manually using your credentials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"\u003eThanks, and enjoy your name ;)!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","created_at":"2015/04/03 23:38:27 +0000","created_at_human":"April  3, 2015 at 11:04 PM UTC"}]}
