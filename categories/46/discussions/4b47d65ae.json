Unfortunately me and some other players have been deceiving you. Breezily Bridging is impossible without an Autoclicker. I autoclick. Even Breezily himself auto clicks, he has admitted it before in skype. If you don't believe that just watch his video again and pay really close attention. He pauses to activate his macros many times and places a lot of blocks by mistake at certain points in the video. Every time you see something sketchy, don't doubt it. Also, why else would he unlist his video? It's really quite obvious, you can see some of those mistakes in my videos too. That's just how it is, It's really very unlikely that you can keep your mouse from moving at all and still be able to hit above 30cps. Those who claim they are able to breezily bridge by clicking in intervals, stop. Clicking to the precision of less than half a second and continuing to do that is very very VERY unlikely. Since overcast is shutting down and Breezily Bridging was a Iconic \"skill\" used on this network I thought I would come out and tell you. I've gone so far to test this as to disable the sensitivity of my mouse and get my brother to spam right click while I use A \u0026amp; D to strafe, and It didn't work. Don't listen to people who say if your blocks don't glitch in your inventory than it's legit, because they didn't in my videos and I was clearly autoclicking. People even do so far as to put clicking sounds in their videos and us their webcams to make pre-recorded videos of their mouse and keyboard, then put them alongside a gameplay video of them bridging to trick you into believing it. Some people have even created subtle macros with synapse to bypass autoclick detectors. Moral of the story is don't trust anyone who says they can Breezily Bridge.
