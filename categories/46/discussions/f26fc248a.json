Voting links are currently being broadcasted in the lobby and so far, there have been 35 votes today. The new lobby messages were pushed today I believed so it definitely made a difference! Now, what if the message said \"Vote for Avicus and get 50 credits!\" I can easily see the number of votes rising to 100. 100 votes a day= 3,000+ votes a month. That would put us near 150th place on the mcservers.org voting page. If voting for credits could miraculously be pulled off by today, we would get a huge lead at the beginning of the month attracting even more players. Those new players that join would also contribute to the voting and I think it's safe to say we can easily be one of the Top 100 servers. It's up to the developers though whether to implement this. Right now is a vital time or else, we would have to wait for the end of August to come by to get another huge lead. Thanks for reading.","body_tagged":"Hi guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood news!
