Logitech has really good, reliable and extremely fast mice for good prices. I'd recomment the G402 Hyperion Fury ultra-fast gaming mouse if you cant spend too much money, or if you can stretch your budget a bit, go for the Logitech G502 Proteus Core. Both of them are excellent, quality mice.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeyboards don't matter so much, although again, Razer keyboards are extremely overpriced, so go for another brand you can trust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as for a mouse pad, well, as long as you have one good enough to stop your mouse from jumping about on your screen, you should be fine!\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e:D","created_at":"2014/12/04 07:10:15 +0000","created_at_human":"December  4, 2014 at  7:12 AM UTC"}]}
