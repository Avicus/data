Honestly I would spend less on the keyboard and more on the mouse, mainly because I don't see a point in getting an expensive gaming keyboard. For me, any keyboard does the job, but the mouse would probably be more important.","body_tagged":"If you want a mouse under $20, I'd recommend the Redragon M601.
