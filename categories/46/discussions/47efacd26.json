I like the \u0026nbsp;easy spamclicking and comboïng, just like most of you.\u003cbr\u003eCons - Even tho it may be fast paced, it doesn't require a whole lot of skill. Yes, I know there are some tactics me as a noob doesn't know, which may be the main reason I suck at it. I feel like after playing an hour of 1.8 pvp, I get bored of it. I need to do something else like building or 1.11, but that may be personal.\u003cbr\u003eI feel like 1.8 is fun to play for me, but only for a short amount of time. I don't agree with people saying 'It's just spamclicking, best mouse wins.', but I do think it's less skilled and quite unfair for some players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.11:\u003cbr\u003ePros - I love this pvp, have to time my hits and also aim, which requires a lot of skill to do. It may be a bit slower paced, but it really isn't that bad at all.\u003cbr\u003eThis version can be customized a lot more than 1.8 too, little example on my own server: You start with normal 1.11 pvp and by upgrading perks you can hit faster and faster.\u003cbr\u003eLots of you may say 'You're special, you're one of the only ones thinking this.', but check out twitch for example; Half of the streams are modded, which doesn't have anything to do with versions, and most of the others are 1.9+. Honestly the only streams on 1.8 or below I can find are the ones with a few viewers, which indicates it's less liked.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, 1.11 pvp scared away quite a lot of cheaters, lots of servers which have both 1.8 and 1.9+ pvp confirmed they get way less reports on higher versions, and more players on those.\u003cbr\u003eCons - It's pretty hard to learn at first. And convincing people to switch / try this kind of pvp is extremely hard. My own 1.9+ server (no advertising :/) staff called me an idiot when updating to 1.9 and above, but after the first few days they got addicted and hate 1.8 right now. Where some of them were full 1.8 pvp addicts at first :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, I think people should play whatever they feel like playing, without telling others they are idiots for playing the other versions...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFish","created_at":"2017/01/16 19:07:45 +0000","created_at_human":"January 16, 2017 at  7:01 PM UTC"}}]}
