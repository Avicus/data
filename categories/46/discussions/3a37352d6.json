Panda137 - Panda was Minecraft's very first gay transgender homophobe midget pvp player, so it should come as no surprise that he/she/it claims this lists first spot. Despite this, his skills remain unmatched. And not in a good way. But as we say to most people of his sexual identity - you tried bud, and that's all that counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. jannerboy - Now this pick is quite orthodox for top player lists, for obvious reasons, but I felt as though he could not be left out. If you're looking for a player with incredible skill, top positioning, map intelligence, admirable work ethic, and superior communication, it's definitely not jannerboy. But he does have one thing - spirit. On the field, he stands out with his spirit and enjoyment for the game, because that's all that counts. As long as you \u0026nbsp;have fun, you can win anything.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Alexis Sanchez - Wait, you may say, this isn't a Minecrafter player! But so you think. You don't know that. Perhaps he is a dual Minecrafter/footballer combo. Nobody knows. But that's besides the point. His abilities on and off the ball are outstanding. He remains one of the world's best dribblers and displays a myriad of eyecatching skills which he utilizes to carry his team - Arsenal. Nobody can deny his talent, no matter how garbage his team may be. Wenger out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. killerbye22 - This might come as a shock, but killerbye made this lost because he possesses a unique skill set. His obesity allows him to excel in Minecraft pvp. Due to his weight, he manages to reduce his knockback by 230%, because moving someone of his stature would need approximately 40 megatons of brute force. Additionally, he consumes so much of the PvP arena that it feels as though he's everywhere at once. Because he is. This makes him a formidable opponent and gives him the #7 spot as one of the greatest players of all time.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. roboticboy16 - \"Good players win you games, great players win you tournaments\". Well Robo can't even win a 1v1. But that's ok. Because what Robo really has is intimidation factor. He's a Latino and American all in one. As a Spanish speaking player, people crap their shorts when they here what sounds like a Latino player about to anal rape them. Yet, at the same time, his American ping gives him a psychological edge over the opponent. Sure, he may lose with 10 hearts. Sure, he might still be playing in quake pro. Sure, he spends most of his time taking food away from his slob of a little brother. But that does not detract from the pure terror he instills into his opponents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. StanMPL but the 2014 version - He invented the blockhit. That should be enough said. Yes, invented it. He worked alongside Dinnerbone and Notch to produce the a mechanic allowing players to block and hit simultaneously, but made sure that it was as broken as possible.

Panda137 - Panda was Minecraft's very first gay transgender homophobe midget pvp player, so it should come as no surprise that he/she/it claims this lists first spot. Despite this, his skills remain unmatched. And not in a good way. But as we say to most people of his sexual identity - you tried bud, and that's all that counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. jannerboy - Now this pick is quite orthodox for top player lists, for obvious reasons, but I felt as though he could not be left out. If you're looking for a player with incredible skill, top positioning, map intelligence, admirable work ethic, and superior communication, it's definitely not jannerboy. But he does have one thing - spirit. On the field, he stands out with his spirit and enjoyment for the game, because that's all that counts. As long as you \u0026nbsp;have fun, you can win anything.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Alexis Sanchez - Wait, you may say, this isn't a Minecrafter player! But so you think. You don't know that. Perhaps he is a dual Minecrafter/footballer combo. Nobody knows. But that's besides the point. His abilities on and off the ball are outstanding. He remains one of the world's best dribblers and displays a myriad of eyecatching skills which he utilizes to carry his team - Arsenal. Nobody can deny his talent, no matter how garbage his team may be. Wenger out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. killerbye22 - This might come as a shock, but killerbye made this lost because he possesses a unique skill set. His obesity allows him to excel in Minecraft pvp. Due to his weight, he manages to reduce his knockback by 230%, because moving someone of his stature would need approximately 40 megatons of brute force. Additionally, he consumes so much of the PvP arena that it feels as though he's everywhere at once. Because he is. This makes him a formidable opponent and gives him the #7 spot as one of the greatest players of all time.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. roboticboy16 - \"Good players win you games, great players win you tournaments\". Well Robo can't even win a 1v1. But that's ok. Because what Robo really has is intimidation factor. He's a Latino and American all in one. As a Spanish speaking player, people crap their shorts when they here what sounds like a Latino player about to anal rape them. Yet, at the same time, his American ping gives him a psychological edge over the opponent. Sure, he may lose with 10 hearts. Sure, he might still be playing in quake pro. Sure, he spends most of his time taking food away from his slob of a little brother. But that does not detract from the pure terror he instills into his opponents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. StanMPL but the 2014 version - He invented the blockhit. That should be enough said. Yes, invented it. He worked alongside Dinnerbone and Notch to produce the a mechanic allowing players to block and hit simultaneously, but made sure that it was as broken as possible. The skill required was minimal but at the same time tremendous. Because of his talent in the ancient form of blockhitting, we've reserved a spot for him on this list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Glitchy1 - Importing specialized fighting techniques from the hit game Jungle Cock, Glotchy1 managed to introduce a never before seen style of pvp into the Minecraft community. This tactic allowed him practically zero success against everyone else because all he did was play Runescape and his skills deteriorated into a malignant wad of headache inducing dribble. But he's still a total jackass. And we love him for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. JuanoMC - \"Go kill yourself\", he once said. Although harsh, this was an effective tactic used by Juano to kill the enemy without even laying his sword upon them. By saying this to them, the opponent would hilariously resort to killing themself, giving Juano the ability to win most every fight. He was one of few players who could permanently defeat his opponents, and that not only takes talent but passion. And he had plenty of both.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. LeafyGreenTea - Have you ever killed LeafyGreenTEa in a match? I thought not. That's because he is unbeatable. He has lost 0% of his duels and always manages to come out on top. Yeah, he may not be completely legit, resorting to ridiculous hacks unseen by any other player before, and they definitely aren't inconspicuous. But it only shows his true desire to be one of the best players in the world - and he has most definitely accomplsihed that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Syncronox - \"Tell syncronox tro drink up the whole bottle of bleach as if it were coke xd\", a wise man once said. Wise indeed. Syncronox had swagger. That's all he needed to be successful. He is the best player EVER!","created_at":"2017/08/28 23:52:31 +0000","created_at_human":"August 28, 2017 at 11:08 PM UTC"}},{"id":380545,"unique_id":"380545-2987","author":{"id":508563,"username":"Mench","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5ecdf615b1424cd797fb4ede125da843?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"u steal packs","body_tagged":"u steal packs","created_at":"2017/09/01 05:52:44 +0000","created_at_human":"September  1, 2017 at  5:09 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":380230,"unique_id":"380230-2059","author":{"id":150062,"username":"cellish","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/50a34639abb34cf1b182204756c49f49?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#2980b9","staff":true},"body":"1. me\u003cbr\u003e2. lolitsalex\u003cbr\u003e3. prestonplayz\u003cbr\u003e4. mrwoofless\u003cbr\u003e5. dantdm\u003cbr\u003e6. my brother\u003cbr\u003e7. captainsparklez\u003cbr\u003e8. jonte_snygg\u003cbr\u003e9.
