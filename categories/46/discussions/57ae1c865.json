This seems like a little too much; Maybe tweak it to 30? I have just recently become #1 on the DTM all time leaderboard and as nice as it is, I shouldn't be there. Some people with Tens of thousands of kills should be not me with only 19k What are your ideas? I personally the leaderboard is helping rushers more than people who spend just as much time killing people.","body_tagged":"From what I recall, a monument is worth around 50 kills.
