When we played yesterday, there were like 5 or less people from each team and then we combined all those player. Even if only 1 person from your team shows up, that's fine. There doesn't have to be a whole team application. If you still don't want your team put up there, please comment again.","created_at":"2015/08/23 22:01:22 +0000","created_at_human":"August 23, 2015 at 10:08 PM UTC"}},{"id":222650,"unique_id":"222650-2921","author":{"id":215946,"username":"PokerFace","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2124417da55a6c5feacfe0c5b4b9bc0?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Join one or create your own so you can be invited.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e@iLavaTiger ok.","body_tagged":"Join one or create your own so you can be invited.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e@iLavaTiger ok.","created_at":"2015/08/24 00:06:50 +0000","created_at_human":"August 24, 2015 at 12:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":222622,"unique_id":"222622-4547","author":{"id":172444,"username":"Okiba","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/718f0061ce15403ca3d45c2852b37434?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"What if you arent in a team?","body_tagged":"What if you arent in a team?","created_at":"2015/08/23 22:12:15 +0000","created_at_human":"August 23, 2015 at 10:08 PM UTC"}},{"id":222759,"unique_id":"222759-3560","author":{"id":299351,"username":"Tynvale","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/2c9372269ed34adc9a0e9747aeee1220?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Team name: Cronus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTag: [CNS]","body_tagged":"Team name: Cronus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTag: [CNS]","created_at":"2015/08/24 08:01:16 +0000","created_at_human":"August 24, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC"},{"id":223092,"unique_id":"223092-3761","author":{"id":215946,"username":"PokerFace","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2124417da55a6c5feacfe0c5b4b9bc0?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Just a little update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I talked to Mango_ and he said that he could make a few TS rooms later on for these scrimmages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I'm working on a Google Doc and thought that just for fun, I would add a player leaderboard for these scrimmages and see what player has won the most of these pick-up scrimmages and such.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Bad Company \u0026amp;
