Since he stopped playing Nebula, all of his videos continue to be viewed, and people keep wondering: \"Where did sfk go?\" As some of his friends know, he's retired. But he's temporarily come out of retirement to play some Nebula tomorrow with me and a few others. If you wanna join us, and hang out with sfkwww, be on tomorrow. If you don't know who sfkwww is: HOW???? Check out his YouTube channel (\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SfkwwwPlaysMC\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/SfkwwwPlaysMC\u003c/a\u003e) and be nice and sub to him.

Anyway Sfkwww will be playing Nebula tomorrow around 3:00 pm central standard time so be there or be square. I'll be recording the whole ordeal, and since we'll be teaming with some of the best rushers in the game, if you're on the other team you better watch out... I'll make a post in the media section when I edit together some of the footage. I've told Sfkwww, XHeat, and JKAwesome to do the same, so it'll be really cool to see from so many different points of view.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace out... or something. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
