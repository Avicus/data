So for thanksgiving I got a new laptop and I've been telling everyone that, it works as a charm but there's one thing in Minecraft that feels weird. I go to Minecraft Servers, and I put new servers like avicus and etc. After I do that, I play a bit of Avicus and another server. Then I close Minecraft. I come back after ten minutes and its all gone. I put all the servers in again, then I go out of the Multiplayer list and come back after a while. Then its gone! And for one last time I put two important servers on my list, and later it somehow dissapeared. Can I please have some help on how to fix this because it is pretty annoying. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: I am back on Forums again, and I'll try to be active. :D","body_tagged":"Hello everyone!
