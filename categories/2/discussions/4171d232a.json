We are bringing back the Old Hall of Fame but adding more recent events but we need your help! The Hall of Fame has special areas to show off events that occurred during tournaments.

This room is that \"secret prize\" I've been talking about for the First place team! This room is going to be a permanent addition to the Hall of Fame. Each player in the winning team will receive a personal 20 by 20 by 30 zone inside this room where they get to build whatever they want (as long as it follows server rules. If abused, the winning team will no longer receive the prize and the second place team will instead be allowed to build). Good luck to the teams participating in the tournament! Hope that your team may be the winning team so I get to see all your creations inside the How ALM Captured Christmas First Place trophy room! May the best team win!

There is no need to worry. The snowstorm has finally passed and our elves can finally get back to work. For today’s gift, we have something special. Avicus now supports Dynamic rotations\u0026nbsp;and it will be put in place in the next couple of days. What this means is that the server’s map pool will adjust depending on how many players are on the server. If the player count is low, you may see a variety of small maps for a small player count. Once that player count increases, you will start seeing bigger maps to fit the player count and maybe some small rewards in the rotation for getting the player count up high. You can make a suggestion either by making a pull request, by suggesting it to\u0026nbsp;a Mapdev on discord, or by responding to this thread. You can find the repository of our rotations \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations?files=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. We can now have countless numbers of rotations used for one server and in the future, we'll potentially support automated rotation cycling every day and different rotations on special occasions or holidays! We also have customizable rot\u0026nbsp;names for such events and automation.\u0026nbsp;Thanks for tuning in let’s hope this snowstorm doesn’t hit us again.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake sure\u0026nbsp;to be here on Sunday (the 17th) for our discord party!

There is no need to worry. The snowstorm has finally passed and our elves can finally get back to work. For today’s gift, we have something special. Avicus now supports Dynamic rotations\u0026nbsp;and it will be put in place in the next couple of days. What this means is that the server’s map pool will adjust depending on how many players are on the server. If the player count is low, you may see a variety of small maps for a small player count. Once that player count increases, you will start seeing bigger maps to fit the player count and maybe some small rewards in the rotation for getting the player count up high. You can make a suggestion either by making a pull request, by suggesting it to\u0026nbsp;a Mapdev on discord, or by responding to this thread. You can find the repository of our rotations \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations?files=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. We can now have countless numbers of rotations used for one server and in the future, we'll potentially support automated rotation cycling every day and different rotations on special occasions or holidays! We also have customizable rot\u0026nbsp;names for such events and automation.\u0026nbsp;Thanks for tuning in let’s hope this snowstorm doesn’t hit us again.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake sure\u0026nbsp;to be here on Sunday (the 17th) for our discord party!

Currently, the presents you have claimed don't show up anywhere, but they are stored and we are planning to use them for some rewards and achievements later in the month. As a part of this hunt, we are bringing back some old lobbies. Every 2 days, a portal will open up that allows you to teleport to an old lobby. These lobbies contain even more presents that you can claim. In order to claim the reward, you only need to claim 2 in each lobby. If you claim all in a lobby, you will get even more rewards when they are added.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSnow Golem Morph\u003c/b\u003e: We are also releasing a \u003cb\u003eFREE\u003c/b\u003e snow golem morph that can be purchased in the in-game store for the rest of the month.

Once that player count increases, you will start seeing bigger maps to fit the player count and maybe some small rewards in the rotation for getting the player count up high.

This room is that \"secret prize\" I've been talking about for the First place team! This room is going to be a permanent addition to the Hall of Fame. Each player in the winning team will receive a personal 20 by 20 by 30 zone inside this room where they get to build whatever they want (as long as it follows server rules. If abused, the winning team will no longer receive the prize and the second place team will instead be allowed to build). Good luck to the teams participating in the tournament!
