We'll catch up on discord later but you've been so loyal and dedicated to any server you join - especially Avicus. Even after pulling the short end of the straw on most situations (specifically in regards to promotions and demotions) you kept going to improve yourself and to prove others wrong. Even if you got into a lot of heated debates you stood your ground.

Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram).

You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you.

I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long.

We'll catch up on discord later but you've been so loyal and dedicated to any server you join - especially Avicus. Even after pulling the short end of the straw on most situations (specifically in regards to promotions and demotions) you kept going to improve yourself and to prove others wrong. Even if you got into a lot of heated debates you stood your ground.

Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram). You're a legend man, and thanks for being a good friend of mine whenn I was still administrator / map developer on the server.

You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you.

My first friend online, not even kidding. I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long.

I was naive about everything; from how I approached things to the ignorance of the malicious scene. You manipulated me and a lot of people, and at the time I overreacted to it - but looking back, it really shaped me into a confident figure.

Every now and thenn I get a message from you on steam asking how I am and how I'm travelling with going pro in Overwatch and/or Call of Duty. Pelly, I love you man.

I remember the pushes we had in public games and go full tryhard mode, and won most of our matches that way.

There's an AFL player called Dustin Martin and occasionally when I hear his name I think of the times you helped me out as a moderator, senior moderator, administrator and friend. How's CC?

We'll catch up on discord later but you've been so loyal and dedicated to any server you join - especially Avicus. Even after pulling the short end of the straw on most situations (specifically in regards to promotions and demotions) you kept going to improve yourself and to prove others wrong. Even if you got into a lot of heated debates you stood your ground. Believe it or not, I was inspired in that and now everyday my IRL friends keep telling me I'm too political and stubborn (in a good way!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow, the emotional bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e{tag=bf3319534f9243ee8abc7544b8234936} - PARASPIDER! Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram). You're a legend man, and thanks for being a good friend of mine whenn I was still administrator / map developer on the server.

You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you. Did you end up enrolling for the marines? I hope you did, because that would have been an awesome experience.

My first friend online, not even kidding. I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long. You'll probably never see this, but if you do, say something. Still, you need to come to Australia - I'll show you around.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e{tag=7f054339a0c347ba8fca0ab2074b7d82} - I've said things about you already (especially in my initial leaving post) but I will say it again. Your hard work was inspirational and I never questioned what you did because I had full faith in your ability to fulfill tasks beyond expectations. Near the end of your time onn Avicus you did get toxic, but that does not change the fact we shared many memories together (especially the promotion to senior mod together) and the Sistahood.

I still remember that man, that was hilarious. In all seriousness, you mentored me when I became Administrator well, annd I think that showed when everyone appreciated the work I put into the server - disregarding whether or not the decisions I made were correct. You constantly (and to an extent you still do) set up video chat parties and teamspeak parties regularly to communicate with the server.

We'll catch up on discord later but you've been so loyal and dedicated to any server you join - especially Avicus. Even after pulling the short end of the straw on most situations (specifically in regards to promotions and demotions) you kept going to improve yourself and to prove others wrong.

Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram).

You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you.

My first friend online, not even kidding. I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long.

We'll catch up on discord later but you've been so loyal and dedicated to any server you join - especially Avicus. Even after pulling the short end of the straw on most situations (specifically in regards to promotions and demotions) you kept going to improve yourself and to prove others wrong. Even if you got into a lot of heated debates you stood your ground. Believe it or not, I was inspired in that and now everyday my IRL friends keep telling me I'm too political and stubborn (in a good way!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow, the emotional bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e{tag=bf3319534f9243ee8abc7544b8234936} - PARASPIDER! Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram). You're a legend man, and thanks for being a good friend of mine whenn I was still administrator / map developer on the server.

You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you. Did you end up enrolling for the marines? I hope you did, because that would have been an awesome experience.

My first friend online, not even kidding. I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long. You'll probably never see this, but if you do, say something. Still, you need to come to Australia - I'll show you around.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e{tag=7f054339a0c347ba8fca0ab2074b7d82} - I've said things about you already (especially in my initial leaving post) but I will say it again. Your hard work was inspirational and I never questioned what you did because I had full faith in your ability to fulfill tasks beyond expectations. Near the end of your time onn Avicus you did get toxic, but that does not change the fact we shared many memories together (especially the promotion to senior mod together) and the Sistahood.

I still remember that man, that was hilarious. In all seriousness, you mentored me when I became Administrator well, annd I think that showed when everyone appreciated the work I put into the server - disregarding whether or not the decisions I made were correct.

No words can describe your influence on me. Giving me a chance as moderator, then promoting me to Senior Moderator with the other two was a memory I'll never forget. You copped a lot of shit back in the day and I supported you because I knew you supported me, and I am forever blessed that you chose me to be your successor for Admin, despite Detty, Telly, Shiro and Dustin being the favourite to replace you. I would have never and still believe I could not completely fill the shoes you left for me, even after the help I seeked from you.

We'll catch up on discord later but you've been so loyal and dedicated to any server you join - especially Avicus. Even after pulling the short end of the straw on most situations (specifically in regards to promotions and demotions) you kept going to improve yourself and to prove others wrong. Even if you got into a lot of heated debates you stood your ground.

Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram). You're a legend man, and thanks for being a good friend of mine whenn I was still administrator / map developer on the server.

You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you. Did you end up enrolling for the marines? I hope you did, because that would have been an awesome experience.

My first friend online, not even kidding. I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long. You'll probably never see this, but if you do, say something.
