It was advertised prior to it being posted on the forums for the whole community to see. While it did contain feedback we are taking into consideration, the way in which the information was presented and discussed is something we do not support. At Avicus, we do want to hear constructive feedback from our community - including staff members. We want our network to have leaders who are willing to communicate their minds maturely and respectfully, which sadly did not happen in this situation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 12.000000953674316px;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 12.000000953674316px;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cfont color=\"#454545\" face=\"Helvetica Neue\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 12.000000953674316px;\"\u003eWhen feedback is presented in a way that is positive and constructive it creates an environment where we can make change. However, the majority of this podcast did not present the feedback in a constructive way. Jabs were taken towards recently demoted staff, past promoted staff, current Admins and more. A leader should not be involved with content which involves disrespect and shame towards a network in which they represent. The podcast was reviewed by the Senior Staff team.

After careful review of the podcast and taking into account nuances such as tone of voice and the manner in which the suggestions were made, we came to the conclusion that Snow was trying to provide feedback in a constructive, not destructive manner; however, a couple of inappropriate comments were still noticed. The other two individuals constantly made rude jokes, leaked some info, and were generally negative towards the network. Snow, on the other hand, seemed to be hesitant to trash the network and to join in on the ridiculing.

It was advertised prior to it being posted on the forums for the whole community to see. While it did contain feedback we are taking into consideration, the way in which the information was presented and discussed is something we do not support. At Avicus, we do want to hear constructive feedback from our community - including staff members. We want our network to have leaders who are willing to communicate their minds maturely and respectfully, which sadly did not happen in this situation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 12.000000953674316px;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 12.000000953674316px;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cfont color=\"#454545\" face=\"Helvetica Neue\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 12.000000953674316px;\"\u003eWhen feedback is presented in a way that is positive and constructive it creates an environment where we can make change. However, the majority of this podcast did not present the feedback in a constructive way. Jabs were taken towards recently demoted staff, past promoted staff, current Admins and more.

After careful review of the podcast and taking into account nuances such as tone of voice and the manner in which the suggestions were made, we came to the conclusion that Snow was trying to provide feedback in a constructive, not destructive manner; however, a couple of inappropriate comments were still noticed. The other two individuals constantly made rude jokes, leaked some info, and were generally negative towards the network. Snow, on the other hand, seemed to be hesitant to trash the network and to join in on the ridiculing.
