It's a shame I probably won't be playing again until 2015 because of my computer blowing up, but I have made so many great friends and this server has already been a great experience for me. We are starting again to strengthen as a server, and I am so happy for this. Now that new prestiges have been added, and I've heard that the lag has been fixed or improved, this will bring in players, especially if people advertise this wonderful community on YouTube. I couldn't have imagined this server any other way, and Avicus is the only thing on Minecraft I play on now xD (and Kohi sometimes). I am so appreciative of the staff on Avicus, and I don't know why people diss IvyCode, he has school, leave him alone, we all do lol. Thanks Ivy for this update, especially lag fixes and 1.8 support. The new /stats is a nice touch, too, and saying \"Cyan Team Wins!\" or something like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you Avicus.
