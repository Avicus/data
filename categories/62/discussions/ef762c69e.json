The main issues were on the server side of things. First off, I want to thank each player, and team for being patient with us throughout dealing with these issues, teams could have gotten more angry and I'm very happy you guys were hanging on with us. I'm just going to go down the line and talk about certain things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eOfficial Servers\u003c/b\u003e: Yes! We were actually ready to start on time! But only one small issue, the scoreboards were not showing up on official servers. You can't play a game mode based on points, without seeing the scoreboard. The servers were put up late the night before, but were not checked for any issues. It sounds rotten, but there was nothing the official team could have done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eScrim Servers:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAfter a thirty minute delay Koja and I had to think fast, so we resorted to the use of scrim servers (yes, you heard me). It was either this or delaying the whole tournament, which I don't think anyone wanted. This did slow the tournament down a bit.. we had to reserve servers, invite the teams to them, veto.. etc. It wasn't as bad as it could have been. Group A was patient with us, and Group B gets the real hoopla for starting over an hour late and still hanging in there to play their matches. Thank you guys for working so efficiently with what we had. On a side note, the Conquest server crashed, but the scrim servers stayed open!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eTournament Staff:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eTo be honest, most of Group A we were very short handed. Koja and I were running the show by ourselves with the help of a couple referees who showed up. Those refs were very flexible with our decisions and I hope they explained it to you very clearly and in a nice tone. Now, for the Streamer team, those of you who know me I am the main guy to stream tournaments and everything on avicus, today that wasn't an option due to me having to officiate and get everything going as fast as possible. We had one streamer who apparently left because he was receiving complaints about his stream, we are looking into it. Xuph streamed a little of Group A, and zicuri was streaming Group B so thanks to those guys for stepping in. Things\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003ewill\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003ebe better for the invitational rounds.

In the middle of the screenshare he logged off, that resulted in him being banned and the team taking round losses for each match the player played in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eDiscord Crash: \u003c/b\u003eThis was the icing on the cake, Middle of Round 1 of Group B, discord crashed and was down for a good hour, so teams instantly jumped to the Avicus TeamSpeak to play, major props to them for thinking outside the box to do that, it was probably the most people on TeamSpeak in a long time too. The event staff had no way to communicate other than in-game chat so they did a good job of improvising too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eNow, onto a more positive note: \u003c/b\u003e8 Teams advanced onto the invitationals to play next Saturday!
