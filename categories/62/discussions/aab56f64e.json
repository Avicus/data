I made it around a year ago with no idea how competitive maps were supposed to work and it generally just doesn't play well. Please remove it\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eArcadia's fine but spawns are way too quick, also prefer the smaller mid with the tiny staircases connecting the sides.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eInjustice plays great, requires actual stratting instead of running round like morons.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eHaven't played endurance yet but it seems really stale and bow spammy like that red and blue map from avicus league.\u003cbr\u003eActrix will play well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo imo remove Strike and Endurance, and add Supply along with Xena TE from BOE1. They're both much more sword heavy and so will change they style of play through the different maps.","created_at":"2017/11/02 08:20:11 +0000","created_at_human":"November  2, 2017 at  8:11 AM UTC"}},{"id":383941,"unique_id":"383941-968","author":{"id":314703,"username":"Wahiz","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/e0429b4918464f298e40ee5762d90a46?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"My team has yet to lose on Arcadia :O","body_tagged":"My team has yet to lose on Arcadia :O","created_at":"2017/11/03 02:47:03 +0000","created_at_human":"November  3, 2017 at  2:11 AM UTC"},{"id":383943,"unique_id":"383943-1375","author":{"id":579625,"username":"OCDs","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/afd1641730d047f792f6ad68f1ce43f2?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"Were scrimming today.
