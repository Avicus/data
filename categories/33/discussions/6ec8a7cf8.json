Not sure if Hive is going to get affect to much, but it will force them to make a down-graded package. For small servers, I know one thats been shutdown due to nobody donating and the owner ran out of money to pay for it. It really is sad that Mojang is doing this, I don't know why they just wont make a moderating team to \"stop\" servers from selling over $1,000 USD kits... Why not?
