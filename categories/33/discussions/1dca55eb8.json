I think in order to have more fun game-play, it should be modified by removing the tunnel in the stairs and making the steps up to the second floor one-block-wide so you can't just sprint jump everywhere without putting any work into it. Then, if you put work into it, you team can get to the center more quickly and win the game because of your building. Maybe that's just me, but for a big builder, I think this map has a lot of potential but needs to be less fully-made.","body_tagged":"I like the map, it just doesn't have very good game-play for builders.
