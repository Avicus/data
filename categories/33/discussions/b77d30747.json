People just like to complain and make excuses. I 8-blocked this kid a lot in a 1v1 and he called me a pinger when I had 40ms and 7cps and proceeded to ragequit. This isn't trying to brag, this is trying to show the dumb stuff people come up with to try and make excuses for their losses and lack of skill. One thing people don't seem to realize is that if they think that tactic is OP then why not use it to your advantage as well?\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eI blockhit a lot, but I know how to properly use it in PvP other than the situations and reasons why you'd use it listed above.","created_at":"2014/12/15 00:09:21 +0000","created_at_human":"December 15, 2014 at 12:12 AM UTC"}},{"id":124002,"unique_id":"124002-1202","author":{"id":330003,"username":"Stimulating","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/779b7f782ecf4da790babb43fb608796?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"ty \u0026lt;3\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut yeah, if all you do is sit there and blockhit you end up losing against someone who knows how to strafe.","body_tagged":"ty \u0026lt;3\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut yeah, if all you do is sit there and blockhit you end up losing against someone who knows how to strafe.","created_at":"2014/12/15 00:22:02 +0000","created_at_human":"December 15, 2014 at 12:12 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":123992,"unique_id":"123992-2188","author":{"id":119545,"username":"Y0urm0m1","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/739cef1a2e8b482da8442ebed62d8b4d?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"i mean ok blockhitting is in general bad but can also be good.
