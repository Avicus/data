First I equip myself with the best armour/ weapons I can get my hands on and an axe if one hasn't been provided. Then break down all the walls and roof and anything surrounding the monument. Put a 2 block high glass wall around the edge of the island with gaps for archery and cover. Have a small roof section (2 blocks or so) just above your head in one area to defend from directly vertical fire. Add wooden pressure plates within the glass wall at the edge so alert you auditorily if someone has broken into your defences. Cover the monument with fences or another transparent object but\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eNEVER COVER IT WITH NON-TRANSPARENT BLOCKS.\u003c/b\u003e Otherwise you cannot see if an intruder is secretly mining your monument from the other side of your coverage. You should be able to hold the island against a high amount of attackers with about 2 people (highly equipped and decently skilled).
