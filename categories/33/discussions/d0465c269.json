I am not saying that the typical [Removed] year old playing would act like that nor trying to discount their credibility from writing this, there are sometimes hackers out there and sometimes are caught by the eye's of players, but normally should not equal a automatic statement from players to shout in chat, curse, or use aggressive language for what they had seen or experienced. Anyway I was playing a nebula map on Luar i believe so, and I had noticed a player that shall not be named, had quite a quick reaction time when it came to hitting players when he/she encountered them. At first i had just discredited this to be probably my ping being high or just a bad response time with my ISP (Internet Service Provider). I later encountered the player after he had fallen from a great height (5 blocks in the sky) and had some wood is their had and without even turning their head to look i was there, the player immediately started to hit me. As i tried to come closer to get the kill i was just hit farther and farther away from them, until they realized they were fighting me and had took their sword out to kill me.
