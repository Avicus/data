During World War III, the U.S. Army created a weapon of mass destruction, a missile that, when detonated, would spread a lethal bacteria that would slowly kill the brain of the affected. Unfortunately, the General fell asleep at the main computer and his face hit the detonate button. But instead of releasing one missile, it\u0026nbsp;released\u0026nbsp;all 5 thousand\u0026nbsp;missiles. The majority of people were affected, except for the few \u0026nbsp;who got to safety.

This is when teammates become important. They can revive fellow zombies, using a golden hoe, called the\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eUndead Touch\u003c/i\u003e. The hoe has a durability of ten revives per each life, so there aren't unlimited revives. Continuing on the one heart idea, reaching one heart, the nearly dead zombie gives off some kind of signal, such as a sound.

What will happen to those in his path?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eStarts with:\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Syringe [Iron sword] with sharpness I, shotgun [bow] with 20 bullets [arrows] and power I plus punch I (This is why there are 20 arrows)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eLevel 10:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eKamikaze- A real team player. This guy will lose one life to blow up a hole in the barricades defending the survivor. Get ready to rumble!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eStarts with\u003c/i\u003e: Wood sword with knockback I, rifle [bow] with 10 arrows, 2 automatic TNT, and one\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eself-destruct\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp;[looks like skeleton head]. Has full leather armor all dyed black so it can sneak to the front lines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eIMPORTANT: The TNT that the Kamikaze has does damage to the survivors like TNT in water, except it also damages barricades. It does not damage the original building itself. The TNT does as much block damage as a normal TNT. The self-destruct destroys as much blocks as 3 TNT exploding side by side. This also damages the opponent, but not teammates themselves. Finally, right before the Kamikaze uses self-destruct, it turns red and a gold helmet flashes on and off on its head. The fuse is five seconds. The kamikaze will not explode if killed during this 5 second pause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eShop\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA shop could be something that both sides could use. Points would be earned by killing members of the other team. Kind of like Nebula.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eSurvivor Shop:\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e1 Point- Slapball: A snowball that does knockback 2 on whoever it hits! Good for keeping the survivors from being swarmed\u003cbr\u003e3 Points- Potion of Regeneration (0:45) Good for an extra boost when getting mobbed\u003cbr\u003e4 Points- Barrier blocks- These are random blocks that come in groups of 16. You click on the random block (possibly a chest item) and receive a random group of blocks! Great for reinforcing blockades and keeping out the zombies!\u003cbr\u003e5 Points- Splash Potion of Swiftness (2:00) Give everyone nearby some speed! Good for getting from floor to floor quickly\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e7 Points-\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eDONATOR ONLY\u003c/b\u003e- Boom Ball- Similar to the Grenades from Nebula, but there's a catch! When you throw this bomb, everyone in the explosion radius only loses 3 hearts! The main purpose is to create craters in the ground to make it difficult for zombies to get to the building\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eZombie Shop\u003c/i\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e1 Point: Bloodlust (0:30) Need that extra boost?

Right? WRONG! Get another 10 teammate revives for only 4 points!\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e5 Points: Launch Pad (Block) Its been boring walking, but now you can fly! Buy this launch pad and place it down, walking over it will boost you 10 blocks forward and up, and you take no fall damage! May death rain upon them!\u003cbr\u003e7 Points:\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eDONATOR ONLY\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp;Acid Spit (Egg) Those survivors have an eagle eye! Not anymore! Throw this egg filled with your chemical waste and blind those fools! The egg has an effect radius of 5 blocks, so try and go for the clumps! (The egg causes blindness II for 5-10 seconds)\u003cbr\u003e10 Points: (Possibly\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eDONATOR ONLY\u003c/b\u003e?) Auto Revive- There are some days when teammates are lousy and only want to help themselves. Well, don't rely on them!
