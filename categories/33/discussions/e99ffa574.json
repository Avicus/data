You don't need to wobble all the way when engaging in the combo itself.","created_at":"2015/04/16 03:50:47 +0000","created_at_human":"April 16, 2015 at  3:04 AM UTC"}},{"id":178107,"unique_id":"178107-1086","author":{"id":415446,"username":"Sho","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/3ad6eca00a6542e3b97726963c916bc8?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I fight some impact members on a daily basis and i've been on OCN for a year +. p sure i know my famous players, thank you very much.
