The best example i can come up with is a recent mach on Proelium. When i joined the game, my team was failing. We where being assailed from the left, right and from the top.

With good brides on the left of the map, we where able to capture the middle of the map, as many where rushing and nobody was being shot off (because of railings on the bridges). After we captured mid, we surrounded the opposite team and where able to destroy 2 monuments. Unfortunately we ended up losing (there defense was EXTREMELY good), but i relised the importance of bridges. So here is my point: when building a bridge from one island to another, don't just make it 1 block wide, but give it railings and make it at least 2 blocks wide. Spend some time and don't rush.
