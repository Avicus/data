I'd say most people get on and just want a fun relaxing, fair game. Then you see there's 4 on one team and 1-2 on all the others in CTH for example, I find it hard to have a good experience in-game when I'm fighting an uphill battle. CTH isn't always populated like Nebula so there's only ever one game at a time, forcing you to play by their rules. It doesn't matter how good the people are the sheer numbers win them the game almost always (unless you're a PvP god and can carry your entire team). This frustrates me as i want a clean, fair game that I can say \"gg\" after and mean it, the other part that frustrates me is that it feels like these people are so intent on winning that they have to put the odds in their favor to win which kind of ruins others' in-game experience because you basically can't win no mater what. Staff do with this what you want but I feel if you're truly striving to make the server better you'd take a look and try to do your best to stop it. There's a difference between team stacking and going into a team with a friend that may or may not be good, anyways I'll leave it after an eternity of writing and let everyone discuss this issue (not written the best in the moment but i'm sure most of us have been pitted against the team stack and know how it feels).\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e-ShadowSlayerZ7","body_tagged":"We all know team stacking exists, all I ask is that we try to clamp down on this issue.
