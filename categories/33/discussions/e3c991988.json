I like to do it when I know the opponent won't be able to hit me, like you can see if his aim is a bit off track.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eBlock hitting:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eMost of you already know what it is, and its very OP in server like Avicus where you have no enchants or speed. (This is why I mostly use scout in Nexus, then I can strafe better). Basically, pretty much everything is useless against block hitting when you don't have any enchants or potions. For those who doesn't know what block hitting is, you just right and left click at the same time. The blocking will reduce the damage you take, and the hit will do more damage on your opponent.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn tunnels:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eJust do block hitting and crits at the same time in the tunnel and you're pretty much unbeatable. Unless your opponent does the same, then its about who is clicking the fastest I think.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eIf\u0026nbsp;you're trapped:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eIf you get pushed into a corner or something like that, block hit. This will make it easier for you to knock the opponent away, as well as you take less damage and make it hard for him to kill you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eIf you get teamed\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e:\u003c/b\u003e Unless you're EXTREMELY good at strafing, block hitting is the safest way. Of course, you can combine strafing with block hitting, which also is very OP. This also takes some time to practice, you don't only have to be a good pvp'er, you need to be smart and have good timing.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe bow/Archery:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eUsing your bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSee the outcome:\u003c/b\u003e A good archer is very good to see where the opponent is about to go. If you aim for the player, he will easily dodge it, due to the bow doesn't hit instantly after you shoot. Try and look and calculate where the opponent is about to go. If he is running to the left, aim a bit more to the left (depends on how far he is from you) than where he really is. The longer away he is, the more to the left you aim.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn close fights:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eDon't pull your bow all the way back. I would suggest pull it to the second pull cross thingy, it does enough damage, takes way less time and makes your arrow go further. If you're longer away then \u003ci\u003e10 blocks from your opponent\u003c/i\u003e, pull it all the way back. If you are within\u003ci\u003e 5-10 away\u003c/i\u003e, pull it to the second pull thingy. If you're \u003ci\u003e5 or less\u003c/i\u003e blocks near your opponent, pull it to the first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eMatsuzen tactic:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eA well known tactic, basically, before you go to a fight, put some good shots on them. This will make them lower on health and make is easier for you to win the fight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eYour FOV matter's:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eYour FOV depends on how you should shoot. If you play on Quake, you basically have to aim right at the opponent. If you play on normal you have to aim quite some hight over your opponent. This depends on how long you are from the opponent and what FOV you play on. I would suggest you to learn your FOV good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eBow spam:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAlso known as the \"nub tactic\". Well, it actually is pretty useful. Bowspam can knock players back, make them low on health before a fight, and push them back if you are low. Doesn't need very much more explaining, does it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eUse the bat:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAs always, practice is the best way of getting better. One of the best ways to practice, if trying to shot a bat. Bats first of all fly, which makes it way harder due to the rapid movements. They are also very small, so they are hard to hit even if they stand still. The also go in\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eevery\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003edirection, so its hard to see the outcome. Players can't fly, they are pretty big, and they can't move as rapidly. The mostly used tactic to dodge arrows is the going right and left. This is quite easy to hit, basically, you only have to shoot in the \"middle\" of their movements. When they go to the right, they expect you to shoot to the right, then when you shoot, they turn left. The same thing on the other side. If you find a middle point, and shoot the other way as they go you hit them. Hard to explain..\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003e\"180\":\u003c/b\u003e When you are low on health and being chased by an opponent, instantly jump, turn around and shot them. This lowers their health, knocks them back and slows them downs, which gives you the opportunity to either regen health, eat or refill etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eGeneral PvP stuff:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThere is a lot of things that can make you a good pvp'er. People say you only need to click fast and have a good aim. Its so much more:\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eAim:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAim \u003cb\u003eis\u003c/b\u003e probably the most important thing in PvP. A good aim makes a good pvp'er. Look up reflex games, a very popular one that can in\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003ecrease your aim is osu! \u0026nbsp;Personally the way I practice my aim is pot pvp'ing. It increases my aim skill, due to the movement, speed 2, and you know, PvP in general helps your aim. So just practice!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eHotkeying:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003ePractise getting things in your hot bar without scrolling with your mouse. Soup PvP and Pot PvP helps your hot keying a lot.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eClick fast/jitter click:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eFast clicking is very important. People say it isn't, because Minecraft only can register a couple of hits per second, but they are wrong. The faster you click, the more hits you will be able to put in your opponent. Also, if you click faster than your opponent, you will get combos on him. And the last thing, which is probably the best, if you click faster than your opponent, you get the first hit. If you click extremely fast you will hit your opponent once as he is in within your range. This is very helpful, if you get the first hit you can start strafing and put a lot of damage into your opponent. Jitter click is basically when you fletch you muscles, and spam the crap out of your mouse, you do all you can to click faster. Real jitter click makes you mouse shake, and people say its harder to aim doing it. But you know, try and click as fast as you can, but make sure you still can manage to have a good aim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eParkour:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003ePvP is mostly in terrain that has hills, water etc. Practice being able to sprint as well as doing the parkour. Use terrain to your advantage. Its good for running away and for chasing. If you're good at park our, you can run away from your opponent, as well as chase him. Practice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eGolden apples:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eUse your golden apples efficiently. One regular golden apple gives you 4 seconds of regeneration 2. If you eat them constantly after each other, you will only get 2 seconds of regeneration of the first apple which in total only gives you 6 seconds of regen. Wait the regen out, and then eat another one. This gives you more health, and you will have to use less golden apples.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eFOV and Sensetivity:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eOf course, this is your choice. Find what you feel confident with. People say that quake pro is the best. I wouldn't say so. Ok, you get a larger field of view (FOV),\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003ebut\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eit makes it way harder to aim. The larger your for is, the smaller the other player get. This makes it harder to keep your aim at the target. If you play on normal, its very easy to keep your aim at the target, it also\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003egoes slower\u003c/b\u003e, so everything doesn't happen so fast, which makes it easier for you to aim. What I mean, if you play on Quake Pro with speed 2, everything will go extremely fast, and hitting your opponent will be very hard if he is strafing you. I would recommend normal. About the sensitivity its all up to you. Slower sensitivity makes it easier to hold your aim at the opponent. but if you can manage to play at a high sensitivity, i think it is better. It helps you get your aim at the opponent if he is strafing you. But, its all up to you, find one you feel comfortable with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eMods:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eMods such as Optifine, Gammabright and HUD mods can help you \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e they are allowed. Use mods as your advantage. Note: Don't use hacked clients\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eBe hyped:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eIn order to play good, you must have to want it yourself.

(This is why I mostly use scout in Nexus, then I can strafe better). Basically, pretty much everything is useless against block hitting when you don't have any enchants or potions. For those who doesn't know what block hitting is, you just right and left click at the same time. The blocking will reduce the damage you take, and the hit will do more damage on your opponent.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn tunnels:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eJust do block hitting and crits at the same time in the tunnel and you're pretty much unbeatable.

Of course, you can combine strafing with block hitting, which also is very OP. This also takes some time to practice, you don't only have to be a good pvp'er, you need to be smart and have good timing.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe bow/Archery:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eUsing your bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSee the outcome:\u003c/b\u003e A good archer is very good to see where the opponent is about to go. If you aim for the player, he will easily dodge it, due to the bow doesn't hit instantly after you shoot. Try and look and calculate where the opponent is about to go. If he is running to the left, aim a bit more to the left (depends on how far he is from you) than where he really is. The longer away he is, the more to the left you aim.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn close fights:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eDon't pull your bow all the way back. I would suggest pull it to the second pull cross thingy, it does enough damage, takes way less time and makes your arrow go further. If you're longer away then \u003ci\u003e10 blocks from your opponent\u003c/i\u003e, pull it all the way back. If you are within\u003ci\u003e 5-10 away\u003c/i\u003e, pull it to the second pull thingy.

If you play on Quake, you basically have to aim right at the opponent. If you play on normal you have to aim quite some hight over your opponent. This depends on how long you are from the opponent and what FOV you play on. I would suggest you to learn your FOV good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eBow spam:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAlso known as the \"nub tactic\". Well, it actually is pretty useful. Bowspam can knock players back, make them low on health before a fight, and push them back if you are low. Doesn't need very much more explaining, does it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eUse the bat:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAs always, practice is the best way of getting better. One of the best ways to practice, if trying to shot a bat. Bats first of all fly, which makes it way harder due to the rapid movements. They are also very small, so they are hard to hit even if they stand still. The also go in\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eevery\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003edirection, so its hard to see the outcome. Players can't fly, they are pretty big, and they can't move as rapidly. The mostly used tactic to dodge arrows is the going right and left. This is quite easy to hit, basically, you only have to shoot in the \"middle\" of their movements. When they go to the right, they expect you to shoot to the right, then when you shoot, they turn left. The same thing on the other side. If you find a middle point, and shoot the other way as they go you hit them. Hard to explain..\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003e\"180\":\u003c/b\u003e When you are low on health and being chased by an opponent, instantly jump, turn around and shot them. This lowers their health, knocks them back and slows them downs, which gives you the opportunity to either regen health, eat or refill etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eGeneral PvP stuff:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eThere is a lot of things that can make you a good pvp'er. People say you only need to click fast and have a good aim. Its so much more:\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eAim:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAim \u003cb\u003eis\u003c/b\u003e probably the most important thing in PvP. A good aim makes a good pvp'er. Look up reflex games, a very popular one that can in\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003ecrease your aim is osu! \u0026nbsp;Personally the way I practice my aim is pot pvp'ing. It increases my aim skill, due to the movement, speed 2, and you know, PvP in general helps your aim. So just practice!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eHotkeying:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003ePractise getting things in your hot bar without scrolling with your mouse. Soup PvP and Pot PvP helps your hot keying a lot.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eClick fast/jitter click:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eFast clicking is very important. People say it isn't, because Minecraft only can register a couple of hits per second, but they are wrong. The faster you click, the more hits you will be able to put in your opponent. Also, if you click faster than your opponent, you will get combos on him. And the last thing, which is probably the best, if you click faster than your opponent, you get the first hit. If you click extremely fast you will hit your opponent once as he is in within your range. This is very helpful, if you get the first hit you can start strafing and put a lot of damage into your opponent. Jitter click is basically when you fletch you muscles, and spam the crap out of your mouse, you do all you can to click faster. Real jitter click makes you mouse shake, and people say its harder to aim doing it. But you know, try and click as fast as you can, but make sure you still can manage to have a good aim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eParkour:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003ePvP is mostly in terrain that has hills, water etc. Practice being able to sprint as well as doing the parkour. Use terrain to your advantage. Its good for running away and for chasing. If you're good at park our, you can run away from your opponent, as well as chase him. Practice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eGolden apples:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eUse your golden apples efficiently. One regular golden apple gives you 4 seconds of regeneration 2. If you eat them constantly after each other, you will only get 2 seconds of regeneration of the first apple which in total only gives you 6 seconds of regen. Wait the regen out, and then eat another one. This gives you more health, and you will have to use less golden apples.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eFOV and Sensetivity:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eOf course, this is your choice. Find what you feel confident with. People say that quake pro is the best. I wouldn't say so. Ok, you get a larger field of view (FOV),\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003ebut\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eit makes it way harder to aim. The larger your for is, the smaller the other player get. This makes it harder to keep your aim at the target. If you play on normal, its very easy to keep your aim at the target, it also\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003egoes slower\u003c/b\u003e, so everything doesn't happen so fast, which makes it easier for you to aim. What I mean, if you play on Quake Pro with speed 2, everything will go extremely fast, and hitting your opponent will be very hard if he is strafing you. I would recommend normal. About the sensitivity its all up to you. Slower sensitivity makes it easier to hold your aim at the opponent. but if you can manage to play at a high sensitivity, i think it is better. It helps you get your aim at the opponent if he is strafing you. But, its all up to you, find one you feel comfortable with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eMods:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eMods such as Optifine, Gammabright and HUD mods can help you \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e they are allowed.
