I'm on my way to Prestige 1, and I've seen a great deal of things from the game. I fell in love with the last-generation maps, like Senex and Rendezvous. In these maps, the spawn has special zoning that blocks any chance of spawn-killing, thus enforcing the rule in a very efficient way. How come so many of the new-generation maps (like previously discussed, Illegal Office) don't have spawn protection anymore? I feel that map makers need to have more restrictions and more importantly, more requirements of their maps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is only my opinion, but having a strict rule against spawn-killing yet not making it difficult to do so seems a bit contradictory to me. You say, \"you cannot eat the forbidden fruit\", yet you basically put it in their mouths. I am not much of one for spawn-killing myself, but if people can't even spawn-kill at all, there's not fear of infractions or unfair gameplay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd another question, why has chat changed so much? I used to not be able to say any curse words and now it's free-reign. And people say horrible stuff, and I can't exactly say \"no cursing!\" because it's not like anything's stopping them. 99% of servers that have chat-restrictions in the rules also have it in the coding. Why did this change? It kind of goes back to the spawn-killing rule. What's the point of having rules when you're giving people more opportunity to break them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Avicus, and I have no complaints, just these two suggestions about my favorite Nebula game.","body_tagged":"I've been an avid Nebula player for a long while, at least six months now.
