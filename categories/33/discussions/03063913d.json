guys, so I recently just unlocked the kit \"Enderman\", and well, I was disappointed. \u0026nbsp;It is the very last kit you can get, so I expected it to be a little stronger than the others (Especially since it is unlocked at a pretty high level). \u0026nbsp;Here's a my review on it:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"

EnderPearls\u003cbr\u003e-Stone Sword\u003cbr\u003e-Full Leather Armour\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that this is really Under powered, espicially since it's the last kit you earn. \u0026nbsp;My idea on how to improve it would be...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Replace Leather Armour With: \u0026nbsp;Chain Chestplate and Pants\u003cbr\u003e-Replace Stone Sword with:\u0026nbsp;Iron Sword\u003cbr\u003e-Replace 5 enderpearls with:\u0026nbsp;3 EnderPearls\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know with the new idea, it has less enderpearls, but you really don't need a lot, only a couple so you can get to places quicker. \u0026nbsp;The Chain Chestplate and Pants are there to because they aren't really too much better than full leather, but still good enough to hold on its own. \u0026nbsp;Finally, this is where I see the most need for improvment, the sword. \u0026nbsp;In my opnion, having a stone sword on this kit really takes away from what the final kit is supposed to hold up to, which is to be good, but not significantly better than all the other kits. \u0026nbsp;I know some of you may say \"It's not that big a deal, it's only a\u0026nbsp;1 Hit point difference\", but trust me, these things do make a big difference in the end. \u0026nbsp;Plus, adding the iron sword instead of the stone won't make it too powerful, because it is not a significant upgrade, but still a noticeable one for the person using the kit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeedback on this idea is appreciated ^_^","body_tagged":"Hey guys, so I recently just unlocked the kit \"Enderman\", and well, I
