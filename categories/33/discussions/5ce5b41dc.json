Usually, my technique on the walls is to rush the middle and take all the chests, but sometimes I prefer to make a skybase and snipe people from above. In the old walls, they had a set height limit and you could build and expand your skybase constantly even after the walls drop. In the new walls, however, all of this has changed. There is now no sky limit, but after the walls drop you can only build your skybase up not out. If you try to expand it says you can't because \"you're not allowed to build in the abyss.\" This new rule has taken away a key aspect of the walls. I don't know if you took it out purposefully or if it was an accident, but either way I suggest you fix it because it will make for a better experience when playing the walls.","body_tagged":"I don't know if this has already been discussed on the forums, as I wouldn't know because there is no search bar, but I am going to make a topic about it regardless.
