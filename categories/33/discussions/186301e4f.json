All you have to do is bridge 200 in the air and just water drop into wool room and because defenders can't go into own wool room, they cant do much. Sure they can shoot you but you'll just fall into your own water. Also in regards to sides, this can go either way but i reckon it should be limited so each team isnt trying to outflank each other 100 blocks wide of the map. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Just what I think, Nathan","created_at":"2014/12/31 08:28:47 +0000","created_at_human":"December 31, 2014 at  8:12 AM UTC"}},{"id":130920,"unique_id":"130920-654","author":{"id":61231,"username":"JKawesome","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/f368651e49d54a4f920c5d9a14079e29?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I haven't played much CTW; only in scrimmages and a few times on OCN.

Sure, you could sneak slowly along the edge, but if someone were to rush on the main path successfully, they'd beat you. Also, of course you wouldn't be able to build anywhere. But there are some useful tactics, like clutching to the side to prevent a death, then speeding off the enemy. You probably wouldn't be able to sneak too close to the wool room like that though. You have some good points there.","created_at":"2014/12/31 09:28:38 +0000","created_at_human":"December 31, 2014 at  9:12 AM UTC"}},{"id":130955,"unique_id":"130955-3167","author":{"id":61231,"username":"JKawesome","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/f368651e49d54a4f920c5d9a14079e29?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Let's take rendezvous 3, for example.
