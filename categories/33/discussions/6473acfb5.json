Again thanks everyone for working on the walls game mode.","body_tagged":"Normally I would have a debate point, but today, I am just glad people are talking about walls. I don't know how things will work with ability vs potion, I just ask that things be tested some before final release. I am also glad the devs \u0026nbsp;are looking into new abilities and kit types.
