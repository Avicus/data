I thought about it and realized \"maybe it's fishing rods and flint and steels\"! Before the most recent update flint and steels were craftable. I remember playing this map, it was the old walls waiting room(if anyone remembers) in the centre chests, there were flame bows fire aspect swords and iron. Back then my goal wasn't the flame items it was always some iron. Our spawning island have gravel so... I made a flint and steel. I remember just having a great time flint and steeling the other teams, comboing them and like eight hearting full iron people. We didn't win, (someone snuck up on our monument) but that game was so much fun. The same kinda thing happens when I get a rod. So my belief is that if the staff allow flint and steels and maybe start you with a fishing rod the game would be more enjoyable. Ok, I know what you are thinking, couldn't people rod people off bridges? Or flint and steel teammates? Well I'm thinking maybe you have to pass a certain level to start with these items (maybe like level 30 or 40) because when you are ranked that high usually you won't be a troll. So this is just an opinion please give feedback in replys.","body_tagged":"So, whenever I play Nebula, I always feel like something on the PVP aspect is missing.
