One day, while the two kings mined together, they found two mysterious green gems with a great aura. They could sense the power radiating from it. They both agreed to take 1 for each region, but Red grew jealous, they wanted both, blah blah blah. Anyway, between the regions was a large area, covered in wood. The leader of Red, Funky, shot their emerald at Blue hoping it was mass destruct all of the Blue region, but \u0026nbsp;Howsie, leader of Blue, reacted and shot up their emerald. Anyway, they collided, and absorbed all of the wood in the field. Suddenly, there's this magical sword floating in the field. It couldn't budge from it's position, and scientists found that it would go to the side with more power. Well, each team had a piece of powerful obsidian. That obsidian kept the power going in the regions. So, if one team broke the other teams obsidian, they won. Then a great war went on, and thousands of years later, the story followed a boy, me, and his friends in the war.","body_tagged":"Now, as many of you have probably forgotten, I used to write a FanFic.
