Lol, people seem like they put their pride \u0026amp; egos on the line every scrim, that's the issue.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eGeneral Thoughts:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho cares? It's just one scrim, you'll get another some other time. Imo, one of the keys to being a good player is try not to stress yourself out or panic, act kinda relaxed. Take the approach of, \"Whatever, this is just another game amongst many, but I'll still try my best for my team.\" and it will benefit people more. No use drowning yourself with the past, why let something so little drag you down? And if you really want to benefit the team, you need to be thinking as clear as possible at all times, which you can't do while salty, frustrated, sad or stressed. I understand passion is a part of every game, but detaching yourself a bit gives you better decision making and strategical thinking overall.","created_at":"2015/08/10 06:25:34 +0000","created_at_human":"August 10, 2015 at  6:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":217624,"unique_id":"217624-3078","author":{"id":6361,"username":"Emmaye","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abed267c620d5e6347952892f3431f7b?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"What's with all the tension between teams in scrimmages lately?
