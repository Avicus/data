Ever since ryan, eric and para have decided to remove their maps not enough have been submitted. Along with this the mapdev team apparently finds it very difficult to look at a map and decide whether to implement it on the server or not, not rocket science. But for me, I find it stupid and pointless removing your maps if they're gonna go to waste, why rub salt into the wound of an already dying competitive scene?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe lack of teams is purely because very little has come from mainly the officials/sr staff in attracting them. Where are the map testing events we were promised? Where's the advertising we were promised? It's not hard to contact a youtuber with 1k+ subs and ask them to record on the server, there's so damn many of them. Map testing is also non-existent, but this is partially to blame on the lack of maps coming to avicus (especially competitive). I'm sure if the officials made a post saying something like, \"Map testing event Saturday 7pm GMT\" then teams that are pretty much dead in the scrimming department such as apollo and allah would show up.

Eg. We Advertise and get 100 new players, only 1/20 of them join competitive, so we get only\u0026nbsp;5 \u0026nbsp; competitive peeps, with 1000, it would be 50, etc. Now I'm just making those numbers up, idk the ratio of kids that stay and become competitive, but you get the point, some will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMap problem:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly it would be a lovely thing if we had one or two lovely maps be added each week, but realistically that isn't going to happen. Why can't the whole mapdev team pick a few times a week and build a map together? There are 10 of you. Most maps have 2-4ish authors, why can't the 10 \u0026nbsp;work together and release a new competitive map every 2nd Saturday/Sunday? Open it with a mega scrim or something, because those and tournaments seem to be the 2 times avicus hits more than the attendance in my math class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutubers:\u003cbr\u003e*You will be here for a while, so please be get comfy for several minutes of reading:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Drop the price of lifetime gold rank and just make it so it \"Can join full teams\". Until you can revive the server. no one wants to purchase the overpriced rank that literally does nothing. Just change lifetime gold to $5 that \"Can join full teams\" and drop the lifetime price of emerald to $30 and I'll explain why later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Get a good public rotation together - Even if the amount of maps is not keeping up with Donald Trump's amount of racist comments, we still have some decent ones. Rend3 DTM and CTW (Put one at the start of rotation, one at the end, so no one remembers there are 2 of them in there), Wahiz, all 3 justices, Senex CTW, Formorgar 2, Rendezvous 1, Sector 6, Sunbeam Temple, Arizona and whatever the new luar is called. Now admittedly half of those don't play well as competitive maps, but some of the public players seem to like 35 people running around Rendezvous 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. If there is enough money to pay developers and server fees, I don't know why there is not enough to pay for some smallish youtuber. Get one with 10k ish subs to start off with. Set a time with them when they will come on and record a game and tell some of us regulars and staff members when that is happening. That way we can have a decent skill level portrayed in the first video. But also it can stop stalemates - If we get all the regulars/staff playing into TS, We can \"Rig\" the game in a way. Youtubers like 15-20 minutes videos \u0026nbsp;on average yeah? So if we have 29/30 people who are playing in TS, we can control that time. Now granted that isn't 100% fair, but it does stop a 3 minute game, that everyone rushes and it stops the \"10 man defense on a team with 15 players, holy shit, we're really good defenders\" game that goes for 3 hours. This way the youtuber, who is probably 12 years old, goes away having a really fun time and conveying the \"This server is fun\" attitude in his video\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. At the end of the video, get the youtuber to say \"I will be playing on this server again next *Insert day here* at *Insert time here* They can have the IP show up on their screen as they say this. Next whatever time and day they pick, if they have 10k subs, I'm going to guess that at least 200 people show up. I imagine it could be a lot more, possibly up to 2000, but I'll be harsh in my numbers to show my point. \u0026nbsp;Those 200 players will soon realise \"Hang on I can't join the game\" Thats when Kylo's clever coding of \"Join full games for $5\" or something of the sort pops up regularly if you are in spectators, we dont wanna spam players with it, but we want our 170 kids in spectator spawn to know about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Thats right, this is where our $5 actually useful and not terribly overpriced rank comes in to play. As I said earlier, the youtuber is probably 12, so his fanbase will be 9 years old on average. Mineplex and Hypixel love 9 year olds and so should we. And if its only $5, not the $50 it is on other servers:\u003cbr\u003e\"MUM I NEED $5!\"\u003cbr\u003e\"What for sweety, we just paid $100 to Madlion, Mineplox and Hi Pixel\"\u003cbr\u003e\"BUT ITS ONLY $5 AND I CAN PLAY WITH CREEPERLEGEND5 (Or any other 10k sub 12 year old name here)\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Lo and behold, by the time they have donated and 60 additional kids have donated and joined to make a 100 player game on wahiz, the youtuber is ready to finish the recording. That is the easiest $300 you will ever see, and remember, I was very harsh on the number of kids that turned up. Now that there are kiddies who know what avicus is and a youtuber who has an understanding of the server, its time to rescue competitive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Out of nowhere a tournament pops up. Apollo or some team that will make it to at least 2nd (xD) can take the youtuber into their team so he doesn't get knocked out first round, ik he is 12, but just put up with him for a few hours. He can record his POV in the tourney. He can make a pre tourney video advertising it, he can include a tutorial on how to enter. Now an army of 9 year olds want to beat their lord and saviour in mineman are at out door. If even 800 of his 10k fans want to get into teams of 16, that is an additional 50 teams. We could have a tourney of 64 teams. I know it would be mainly made up of 9 year olds and 12 year olds but you get the point, we have a big tourney with a captive audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Now this step is optional and will probably recieve backlash, but we need money to keep avicus alive and because 9 year olds will likely pay us anyway. Add a new feature to teams called \"Premium\" which is a simple yes/no option. To play in this tournament, your team must be premium. The premium cost is $30, hey thats exactly what you said the emerald rank should cost, exactly! Or it could be made up of 6 players who have the gold rank:6 x $5 = $30. Now already existing teams will get around this as they already have $30 of donation in them, so they'll be premium already. Make this tournament premium and between 16 9 year olds getting the chance to play with their hero, we will get $30 from their team. 50 teams of 9 year olds x $30 = $1500. Not bad for our first tourney - with only a 10k youtuber.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. By this stage we could go wild, we could buy a bigger youtuber, offer cash prizes for the next tournament, which of course would be premium too. We would be more well known in the world of servers and could look at doing deals such as contradeals with other big servers. I remember there was avicus merchandise somewhere, maybe we could offer that through our youtubers, maybe give them 20% of sales? So we have a variety of options here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo by step 9 we have:\u003cbr\u003e*A decent playerbase, probably better than decent.\u003cbr\u003e*Youtuber/s who have a good relationship with community, whether we keep the small 12 year old or expand into a bigger youtuber who knows, but we have the funds for this.\u003cbr\u003e*Possible way to make merchandise work\u003cbr\u003e*Money\u003cbr\u003e*New blood in competitive scene\u003cbr\u003e*With several hundred more kids on, some of which will undoubtedly go on to become mapdevs, hey thats another problem solved\u003cbr\u003e*Possible partnerships/contradeals with other servers who were before unwilling to deal with us because we were so small, but now are taking us seriously\u003cbr\u003e*Ranks which people are actually willing to buy.\u003cbr\u003e*No need for threads like \"HELLO ADMINS, SERVER IS DED\" or \"How long do we have left\" or this thread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThats just how I would do it, my 10c worth.","body_tagged":"Ok this is beginning to trigger me here.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, we need to clearly define that we need more players before some go competitive. Eg. We Advertise and get 100 new players, only 1/20 of them join competitive, so we get only\u0026nbsp;5 \u0026nbsp; competitive peeps, with 1000, it would be 50, etc. Now I'm just making those numbers up, idk the ratio of kids that stay and become competitive, but you get the point, some will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMap problem:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly it would be a lovely thing if we had one or two lovely maps be added each week, but realistically that isn't going to happen. Why can't the whole mapdev team pick a few times a week and build a map together? There are 10 of you. Most maps have 2-4ish authors, why can't the 10 \u0026nbsp;work together and release a new competitive map every 2nd Saturday/Sunday? Open it with a mega scrim or something, because those and tournaments seem to be the 2 times avicus hits more than the attendance in my math class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutubers:\u003cbr\u003e*You will be here for a while, so please be get comfy for several minutes of reading:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Drop the price of lifetime gold rank and just make it so it \"Can join full teams\". Until you can revive the server. no one wants to purchase the overpriced rank that literally does nothing. Just change lifetime gold to $5 that \"Can join full teams\" and drop the lifetime price of emerald to $30 and I'll explain why later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Get a good public rotation together - Even if the amount of maps is not keeping up with Donald Trump's amount of racist comments, we still have some decent ones. Rend3 DTM and CTW (Put one at the start of rotation, one at the end, so no one remembers there are 2 of them in there), Wahiz, all 3 justices, Senex CTW, Formorgar 2, Rendezvous 1, Sector 6, Sunbeam Temple, Arizona and whatever the new luar is called. Now admittedly half of those don't play well as competitive maps, but some of the public players seem to like 35 people running around Rendezvous 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. If there is enough money to pay developers and server fees, I don't know why there is not enough to pay for some smallish youtuber. Get one with 10k ish subs to start off with. Set a time with them when they will come on and record a game and tell some of us regulars and staff members when that is happening. That way we can have a decent skill level portrayed in the first video. But also it can stop stalemates - If we get all the regulars/staff playing into TS, We can \"Rig\" the game in a way. Youtubers like 15-20 minutes videos \u0026nbsp;on average yeah? So if we have 29/30 people who are playing in TS, we can control that time. Now granted that isn't 100% fair, but it does stop a 3 minute game, that everyone rushes and it stops the \"10 man defense on a team with 15 players, holy shit, we're really good defenders\" game that goes for 3 hours. This way the youtuber, who is probably 12 years old, goes away having a really fun time and conveying the \"This server is fun\" attitude in his video\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. At the end of the video, get the youtuber to say \"I will be playing on this server again next *Insert day here* at *Insert time here* They can have the IP show up on their screen as they say this. Next whatever time and day they pick, if they have 10k subs, I'm going to guess that at least 200 people show up. I imagine it could be a lot more, possibly up to 2000, but I'll be harsh in my numbers to show my point. \u0026nbsp;Those 200 players will soon realise \"Hang on I can't join the game\" Thats when Kylo's clever coding of \"Join full games for $5\" or something of the sort pops up regularly if you are in spectators, we dont wanna spam players with it, but we want our 170 kids in spectator spawn to know about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5.

I imagine it could be a lot more, possibly up to 2000, but I'll be harsh in my numbers to show my point. \u0026nbsp;Those 200 players will soon realise \"Hang on I can't join the game\" Thats when Kylo's clever coding of \"Join full games for $5\" or something of the sort pops up regularly if you are in spectators, we dont wanna spam players with it, but we want our 170 kids in spectator spawn to know about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Thats right, this is where our $5 actually useful and not terribly overpriced rank comes in to play. As I said earlier, the youtuber is probably 12, so his fanbase will be 9 years old on average. Mineplex and Hypixel love 9 year olds and so should we. And if its only $5, not the $50 it is on other servers:\u003cbr\u003e\"MUM I NEED $5!\"\u003cbr\u003e\"What for sweety, we just paid $100 to Madlion, Mineplox and Hi Pixel\"\u003cbr\u003e\"BUT ITS ONLY $5 AND I CAN PLAY WITH CREEPERLEGEND5 (Or any other 10k sub 12 year old name here)\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Lo and behold, by the time they have donated and 60 additional kids have donated and joined to make a 100 player game on wahiz, the youtuber is ready to finish the recording. That is the easiest $300 you will ever see, and remember, I was very harsh on the number of kids that turned up. Now that there are kiddies who know what avicus is and a youtuber who has an understanding of the server, its time to rescue competitive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Out of nowhere a tournament pops up. Apollo or some team that will make it to at least 2nd (xD) can take the youtuber into their team so he doesn't get knocked out first round, ik he is 12, but just put up with him for a few hours. He can record his POV in the tourney. He can make a pre tourney video advertising it, he can include a tutorial on how to enter. Now an army of 9 year olds want to beat their lord and saviour in mineman are at out door. If even 800 of his 10k fans want to get into teams of 16, that is an additional 50 teams. We could have a tourney of 64 teams. I know it would be mainly made up of 9 year olds and 12 year olds but you get the point, we have a big tourney with a captive audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Now this step is optional and will probably recieve backlash, but we need money to keep avicus alive and because 9 year olds will likely pay us anyway. Add a new feature to teams called \"Premium\" which is a simple yes/no option. To play in this tournament, your team must be premium. The premium cost is $30, hey thats exactly what you said the emerald rank should cost, exactly! Or it could be made up of 6 players who have the gold rank:6 x $5 = $30. Now already existing teams will get around this as they already have $30 of donation in them, so they'll be premium already. Make this tournament premium and between 16 9 year olds getting the chance to play with their hero, we will get $30 from their team. 50 teams of 9 year olds x $30 = $1500. Not bad for our first tourney - with only a 10k youtuber.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. By this stage we could go wild, we could buy a bigger youtuber, offer cash prizes for the next tournament, which of course would be premium too. We would be more well known in the world of servers and could look at doing deals such as contradeals with other big servers. I remember there was avicus merchandise somewhere, maybe we could offer that through our youtubers, maybe give them 20% of sales? So we have a variety of options here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo by step 9 we have:\u003cbr\u003e*A decent playerbase, probably better than decent.\u003cbr\u003e*Youtuber/s who have a good relationship with community, whether we keep the small 12 year old or expand into a bigger youtuber who knows, but we have the funds for this.\u003cbr\u003e*Possible way to make merchandise work\u003cbr\u003e*Money\u003cbr\u003e*New blood in competitive scene\u003cbr\u003e*With several hundred more kids on, some of which will undoubtedly go on to become mapdevs, hey thats another problem solved\u003cbr\u003e*Possible partnerships/contradeals with other servers who were before unwilling to deal with us because we were so small, but now are taking us seriously\u003cbr\u003e*Ranks which people are actually willing to buy.\u003cbr\u003e*No need for threads like \"HELLO ADMINS, SERVER IS DED\" or \"How long do we have left\" or this thread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThats just how I would do it, my 10c worth.","created_at":"2017/02/22 20:30:42 +0000","created_at_human":"February 22, 2017 at  8:02 PM

this is beginning to trigger me here.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, we need to clearly define that we need more players before some go competitive. Eg. We Advertise and get 100 new players, only 1/20 of them join competitive, so we get only\u0026nbsp;5 \u0026nbsp; competitive peeps, with 1000, it would be 50, etc. Now I'm just making those numbers up, idk the ratio of kids that stay and become competitive, but you get the point, some will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMap problem:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly it would be a lovely thing if we had one or two lovely maps be added each week, but realistically that isn't going to happen. Why can't the whole mapdev team pick a few times a week and build a map together? There are 10 of you. Most maps have 2-4ish authors, why can't the 10 \u0026nbsp;work together and release a new competitive map every 2nd Saturday/Sunday? Open it with a mega scrim or something, because those and tournaments seem to be the 2 times avicus hits more than the attendance in my math class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutubers:\u003cbr\u003e*You will be here for a while, so please be get comfy for several minutes of reading:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Drop the price of lifetime gold rank and just make it so it \"Can join full teams\". Until you can revive the server. no one wants to purchase the overpriced rank that literally does nothing. Just change lifetime gold to $5 that \"Can join full teams\" and drop the lifetime price of emerald to $30 and I'll explain why later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Get a good public rotation together - Even if the amount of maps is not keeping up with Donald Trump's amount of racist comments, we still have some decent ones. Rend3 DTM and CTW (Put one at the start of rotation, one at the end, so no one remembers there are 2 of them in there), Wahiz, all 3 justices, Senex CTW, Formorgar 2, Rendezvous 1, Sector 6, Sunbeam Temple, Arizona and whatever the new luar is called. Now admittedly half of those don't play well as competitive maps, but some of the public players seem to like 35 people running around Rendezvous 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. If there is enough money to pay developers and server fees, I don't know why there is not enough to pay for some smallish youtuber. Get one with 10k ish subs to start off with. Set a time with them when they will come on and record a game and tell some of us regulars and staff members when that is happening. That way we can have a decent skill level portrayed in the first video. But also it can stop stalemates - If we get all the regulars/staff playing into TS, We can \"Rig\" the game in a way. Youtubers like 15-20 minutes videos \u0026nbsp;on average yeah? So if we have 29/30 people who are playing in TS, we can control that time. Now granted that isn't 100% fair, but it does stop a 3 minute game, that everyone rushes and it stops the \"10 man defense on a team with 15 players, holy shit, we're really good defenders\" game that goes for 3 hours. This way the youtuber, who is probably 12 years old, goes away having a really fun time and conveying the \"This server is fun\" attitude in his video\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. At the end of the video, get the youtuber to say \"I will be playing on this server again next *Insert day here* at *Insert time here* They can have the IP show up on their screen as they say this.

They have a huge competitive player base and one of the things that caused this is an advanced statistics page.
