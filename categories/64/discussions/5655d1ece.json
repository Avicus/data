So ocn was the competitive server I grew up with. However once it closed I migrated here and learned to love it. However Avicus does not have things called Safety Wools or Proximity (?). So this Tm is CTW and probably doesn't want to create what was t5. I would like to think that they should implement safety wools. If Avicus allowed safety wools in scrims or tms it would allow for easier gameplay. It could help worser teams to cap against better teams and allow for second chances. Safety wools also allow for easier tms. Safety wools also introduce the idea of Prox. I don't know how Avicus run CTW tms, but what I have heard is that Prox does not occur. Avicus should implement proximity in all CTW tm matches\u0026nbsp; via safety wools. I believe that it would be easier to\u0026nbsp; eliminate ties between teams. These are all just my opinions but yeah.
