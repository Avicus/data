You seem to me like a really chill person in general and as moderator I find that you do your job well and that you aren't super sweaty to go that extra mile to give an infraction. However, to be honest, I kind of feel that sometimes you get triggered and say things in chat that mods probably shouldn't say to be a good example but idk if you're joking or not.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn on the other hand I remember playing with you on Necromancy a long time ago as xSped and it was actually quite fun lol, but then I decided to quit for like 6 months so idk what happened...I don't remember much but I remember that you were a really easy to kill player but now that you have improved, you are much harder and kill and i think you'll grow to be a very strong comptivite player if you increase in skill the way you are increasing.
