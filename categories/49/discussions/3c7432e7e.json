I am Tpk42 (used to be The_K_Bros), or you can call me by my first name, Tristan.\u003cbr\u003eI'm a student getting ready to go to college in the fall. I'm not sure what my plan for a career is yet, but i'm seriously considering Music Education. I've played saxophone with my school district's various bands for about 8 years now, including the concert, marching, and jazz bands (My personal favorite was always the jazz band. I love improvising). I've gotten pretty decent in that amount of time, winning the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award just this year :D.\u003cbr\u003eMusic shaped a large part of my past 10 years, and I wouldn't have the friends and life I do now. If I didn't get into music, I probably wouldn't have made it through high school (drop out from bullying, bad grades, etc.).\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eMusic isn't the only thing I enjoy though. I love gaming as well. I got hooked on Minecraft about 3 years ago (just realized its been 3 years, wow lol) when I watched paulsoaresjr play. I came to Minecraft for the game-play, and stayed for the endless possibilities, free running creativity, and the music. When I have a bad day, the mellow music of Minecraft always has a way of making me happy.\u003cbr\u003eI've lurked around Avicus for almost as long as I've had the game. My little brother showed me Nebula, and I've played on and off ever since. I've figure now that I've lurked in the background long enough, and I want to get more involved in the community.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eSo, go ahead and ask me anything you want. I think I've given enough info about me to start. If not, that why this is an AMA discussion :P.\u003cbr\u003e~Tpk42","body_tagged":"Hello all!
