You always try to do the right thing and you stay calm when everything around you is falling apart. Your dedication toward helping the server and just people in general is amazing and I really respect you for that. I remember when I was new to the server I always wanted to be in your team because I knew we'd win because of you getting all the monuments. I'm glad there's people like you on this server and I'm glad I got to know you a little better.","created_at":"2016/01/27 22:50:40 +0000","created_at_human":"January 27, 2016 at 10:01 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":274438,"unique_id":"274438-2470","author":{"id":215946,"username":"PokerFace","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2124417da55a6c5feacfe0c5b4b9bc0?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Opinions on me?","body_tagged":"Opinions on me?","created_at":"2016/01/27 06:21:07 +0000","created_at_human":"January 27, 2016 at  6:01 AM UTC"}},{"id":274618,"unique_id":"274618-1807","author":{"id":60174,"username":"Arigenn","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/701196d59e574bc9c19b7f63e1fbfaef?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"How many boards\u003cbr\u003e Could the Mongols hoard\u003cbr\u003e If the Mongol hordes got bored?","body_tagged":"How many boards\u003cbr\u003e Could the Mongols hoard\u003cbr\u003e If the Mongol hordes got bored?","created_at":"2016/01/28 00:16:04 +0000","created_at_human":"January 28, 2016 at 12:01 AM UTC"},{"id":274681,"unique_id":"274681-714","author":{"id":306139,"username":"Loo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/dd725af0c6604eb6be334aca40897048?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;\"\u003eWhat team do you prefer, Berzerk or PPB?
