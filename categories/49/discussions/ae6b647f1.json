I think several changes could have been made to sustain the server's life. Apple did end up making the decision though, which I respect. Some people have claimed that if the server was kept alive, it would not be the \"true\" experience, but I still think it could remain authentic as Overcast was not always this network that connects 20+ servers with all different gamemodes. It all started with one server, slowly growing into many more. Many people recollect the \"good ol' days,\" while others claim it would not be right to revert to a state similar to them. While I'm sad that it's closing down, I don't think there was anything I could personally have done to help the server, nor any one individual could have done.
