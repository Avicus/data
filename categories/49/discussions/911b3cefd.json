This server, of course, was Avicus and at the time, I was the generic noob, sporting the classic Steve skin and hiding at bedrock in the walls to try and run out the clock. After about five minutes of playing, I was hooked. Every day after school I would hop on the computer and play the walls. After many late nights and hours of playing, I started to figure out all the tricks and secrets in the walls and started to become pretty decent at PvP. After a few more late nights, I was pretty much unstopable. I soon became bored of feasting on the souls of noobs in the walls so I decided to try the game that would forever change my perspective on Minecraft: nebula. I was instantly hooked, and soon I became one of the more active members in the Avicus community. I practiced hard and soon became a reputable player. I was scrolling through the forums one night and one heading caught my eye: \"Avicus Clan: Robotic something\" (couldn't remember exact title, ha). I applied and was soon tested by robo. Luckily, even though I played worse than I had since I started, I made the team and became an offensive player. Within a week or so, myself along with the clan were fighting in battles across multiple servers and were enjoying every second, but as soon as it started it ended. Life started to catch up to me and I had the hard realization I needed to cut down on playing time and focus more on the world around me. As a result, I quit the team and for quite a while I was completely inactive. A few months later, as a result of extreme boredom I decided I would give Avicus another go. Once again, I found myself obsessed playing Nebula constantly. I joined another clan, but the cycle repeated itself. Life caught back up to me, and I again quit the team. A few more months later, I decided I was forever done with Minecraft and I chose to \"go out with a bang\" and do something I deeply regret. I embarked on the pointless, idiotic mission to be banned from every server I could. I downloaded a hacked client and went on every server I could find and hacked. Within a short time I was banned from every server, except one: Avicus. The responsible me should have said \u0026nbsp;\"Hey Caleb, I think it would be smart not to get banned from this server because not only have you donated $50, but you also have many friends that trust you and respect you that would feel betrayed if you decided to disrespect them and the server by hacking,\" but of course, I think we all know what I decided. I turned on my speed hacks and within five minutes was temporarily banned from Avicus. Fast foward a few months, and here I am writing this discussion. Many of you may be wondering why I would write this and why I would dare talk on the forums of a server I so blatantly disrecpected. Well, I am here to say sorry and semi re-establish myself into this community. I know many people will not be able to accept my apology and I completely understand how you feel about this whole situation, but to the few that do I would like to say thanks and I greatly appreciate you welcoming me back. In the future, you can expect no hacking and I will try my best to get on every once in a while and enjoy a game of walls or nebula. If you see me in a game say \"Hi,\" I love talking and definitely do not bite, unless you kill me a bunch of times, ha. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Thanks everyone for taking the time to read my entire discussion and I am looking forward to seeing everyone in game, \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Caleb_MC","body_tagged":"Hello Avicus community!\u003cbr\u003eAround a year ago, I stumbled upon a wonderful server which would lead me down a path of friendship, enjoyment, and eventual betrayal.
