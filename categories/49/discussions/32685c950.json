The only thing you have to do in order to become a top tier player is learn how to play the game, or the OCN style of game, since everyone is able to play Avicus without having gamesense. You are also willing to learn and improve, this is something people say they have but in the end they actually don't. Luckily, you do want to actually learn an improve and I'm glad we have you in Apollo and I would not want to swap you out for anyone else. \u0026nbsp;You are also the person that always helps people out, thanks for everything Eric.","created_at":"2016/12/25 10:42:59 +0000","created_at_human":"December 25, 2016 at 10:12 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":348798,"unique_id":"348798-2632","author":{"id":517510,"username":"Xuph","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"opnion","body_tagged":"opnion","created_at":"2016/12/24 19:20:54 +0000","created_at_human":"December 24, 2016 at  7:12 PM UTC"}},{"id":348990,"unique_id":"348990-858","author":{"id":229689,"username":"JustBudah","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/71a5754115dd4df99eb6b591df9859a1?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Nope not yet, aura and spookz are still in the team!!!","body_tagged":"Nope not yet, aura and spookz are still in the team!!!","created_at":"2016/12/25 10:46:26 +0000","created_at_human":"December 25, 2016 at 10:12 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":348801,"unique_id":"348801-3978","author":{"id":15863,"username":"Iron","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/20017ca515fe4708893563db33af58ef?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Have you learnt how to handle 12 year old apollo salt???","body_tagged":"Have you learnt how to handle 12 year old apollo salt???","created_at":"2016/12/24 19:35:22 +0000","created_at_human":"December 24, 2016 at  7:12 PM UTC"}},{"id":348991,"unique_id":"348991-2616","author":{"id":122862,"username":"Eteh","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e37c72b6a9d6c22721e3bb988ca6e6e9?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Opinions?","body_tagged":"Opinions?","created_at":"2016/12/25 11:04:46 +0000","created_at_human":"December 25, 2016 at 11:12 AM UTC"},{"id":349006,"unique_id":"349006-2790","author":{"id":11632,"username":"Zeusy","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/e094471b4c13471584f402f7d88cfe5a?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"my g\u003cbr\u003ehonest opinions?
