I'm 13 years old, but mah b-day is 9/11. I have actually been on Avicus for about a year now, and I've been having really annoying game bugs, so I can't register, but hey I'm here! Um I play Nebula a lot like \u003cb\u003eA LOT\u003c/b\u003e. I kinda like Nexus as it's a constant battle of two teams, mostly having 5-10 players when I'm on, so yea lots of deaths. I'm not the kind of person that enjoys really slow gamemodes that all you do is eat, mine, fight, die. I would be tearing my hair out 15 minutes in 'cause of the all work you have to do, so lazy :P. When I'm on Nebula I always go straight to armour, I love being op :3. I can build and pvp moderately well, I \u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eLOVE\u0026nbsp;\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e team deathmatches, especially when they have pots :D. So I'm a player that likes fast moving pvp games and can get a bit too COMpetitive sometimes, but I mean c'mon it's a game. I will be watching the forums quite a lot, but won't post loads of replies/topics. So on the forums I am a brand new player, but in-game I've been here for a year. So yea. anyways. cool server. yea. um. I'm gonna go now... Oh and I love football and all sports ^-^","body_tagged":"Hey everyone I'm J420ac10k, but by all means please call me Jack!
