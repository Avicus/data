You are very active on all platforms, so you can find a way to help Avicus and the people. Also, you have a great personality (although I don't know that much). In your videos, I really like it how you stick to your opinion towards the end. I hope you continue to be like this. Because in a way, this type of attitude is what upgrades the server. Not through plug-ins or codes, but in mentality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much! I hope you have a great day as well.","created_at":"2016/08/11 10:36:00 +0000","created_at_human":"August 11, 2016 at 10:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":327476,"unique_id":"327476-4721","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"Happy Birthday!

I respect the beliefs of Muslims, and other religions. I don't have many opinions for Allah. God and Allah, I don't see them as equals, but I believe that even if I don't believe in Allah, I should still respect other people's beliefs. I think Allah is ok. :) Sorry, but I can't say much...","created_at":"2016/08/11 10:58:16 +0000","created_at_human":"August 11, 2016 at 10:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":327736,"unique_id":"327736-1500","author":{"id":360748,"username":"KojaCola","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/075b5514293a4bd5bcef367e687d3556?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Happy B-Day!!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFav map?","body_tagged":"Happy B-Day!!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFav map?","created_at":"2016/08/11 23:14:12 +0000","created_at_human":"August 11, 2016 at 11:08 PM UTC"},{"id":327751,"unique_id":"327751-3527","author":{"id":4913,"username":"Zintenka","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/1865ac01271f4f69b979b43a78c39989?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Happy Birthday, fam! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would you do if you had a tank?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions on me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCake or Pie?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving fun for your B-day? :)","body_tagged":"Happy Birthday, fam! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would you do if you had a tank?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpinions on me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCake or Pie?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving fun for your B-day? :)","created_at":"2016/08/12 01:02:55 +0000","created_at_human":"August 12, 2016 at  1:08 AM UTC"},{"id":327820,"unique_id":"327820-3622","author":{"id":497178,"username":"twopump","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/58b9ab0f83cf43c1b53baecd64ed2838?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"To specify, just asking you to find the square root of the parabola, and to be more precise I meant to say what would be your idea of fun?","body_tagged":"To specify, just asking you to find the square root of the parabola, and to be more precise I meant to say what would be your idea of fun?","created_at":"2016/08/12 11:04:40 +0000","created_at_human":"August 12, 2016 at 11:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":327613,"unique_id":"327613-1382","author":{"id":525724,"username":"Han_So_Hyun","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/decf6a0c8a7c4463b78165d050a39d7f?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"Hi BWD!!!!
