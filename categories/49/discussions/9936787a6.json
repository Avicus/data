Apart from that, we have actually talked in TeamSpeak quite a few times, and I can definitely say that I've very much enjoyed those times. You are a very amiable and approachable person, and I admire the fact that you're always looking to socialize and interact more with people, especially fellow staff. Even in Slack, I always see you giving suggestions and gaining feedback from fellow staff on your own performances, which is something that I'm very much impressed by. As a moderator, you've always had great performances, and I always know that you'll only improve more and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEDIT: Now that I think about it, I probably could've elaborated more on a couple answers, lol.

It doesn't have unnecessary subteams or ranks, and each rank/position we have currently serve their own purpose that all relate to keeping the server going. There are many servers that are very different from this, some of which I have been staff on.

The initial flop there left me with a couple questions regarding the planning that went into the update, but it's not something that I wish to hold against the team, since I myself do not know the full story. Apart from those flops that you guys may or may not have full control over, you guys do still push out bug fixes, updates, as well as little additions to the forums, and ingame (guess TS devs are technically a subteam of the Developer team, so can always include them here as well^^), so I do like that very much.

I personally do not have high interest in development, and I'm not very knowledgeable about how developing works, so I can't really give a detailed opinion on the team. I do not know what happens in the background when it comes to development, so I don't feel too comfortable commenting too much on the early days of the Atlas update, which we all know had some questionable moments. The initial flop there left me with a couple questions regarding the planning that went into the update, but it's not something that I wish to hold against the team, since I myself do not know the full story.
