Its just a block game and it cant really affect your RL unless you take it very serious. You're also getting pissed pretty easily. I told you many times, ignore things that annoys you even the people you can call your \"friends\". I'm telling you that from personal experience and I suggest you to listen me.

You're such a nice person to me. I like you as a friend a lot. We talk and joke everytime we're in ts. We stopped talking recently because you switched to discord and I really dislike discord for talking. You're taking this game too serious which isnt good, trust me. Its just a block game and it cant really affect your RL unless you take it very serious. You're also getting pissed pretty easily. I told you many times, ignore things that annoys you even the people you can call your \"friends\". I'm telling you that from personal experience and I suggest you to listen me. As a player you sweat this game a lot. You improved so much in melee when prestiges became a thing. You make armor almost every time and that just shows how \"sweaty\" you are xd.
