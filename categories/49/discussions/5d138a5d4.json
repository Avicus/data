Geez, no need to be mean. that gif was only a joke :c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born on May 29,1999. I was a very playful and hyper kid, always loved candy and loved breaking things aroungd the house but i got some near death exoeriences. in my elemetnary school years, i always hanged out with kids 1-3 grades below me so i felt left out but i was still cool to my grade. I was always the shortest kid until 6th grade where i was taller than 1 kid. I was pretty smart in elmentary school. Learned my times table at 1st grade, got accepted in GATE program (Gifted And Talaented Education) and i kept geting lots of awards. 4th grade was my worst year cause i didn't get any awards lol. I also developed a cheating method in the 1st grade. When we took a test, we would always put these cubbie boards where we cant see the test from the persons next to you and in front of you. So what i did is i asked the teacher for tissue, she would say yes and i would walk around the class room looking on other peoples tests. Of course, i only did once or twice but the other students realized what my tactic was and copied me. Then, almost all the students startin usin it and when it was a test, all the students would practically ask for tissue. Teacher realized it and we all got in trouble lol. All the other kids would try to get homework from me so i was pretty ticked off from them. By the end of the 6th grade, i realized i had only 1-2 real friends. At middle school, i decided to leave my elementary school click and move on. So i found another group and hanged out with them. Middle school years were the best years. In p.e, we would alwyas towel whip each other, there were fights in the locker rooms, and this one kid that is not special ed, he is so funny. He would always get in trouble everyday for doing something random. One time, he danced on a tablle with a trash can on hi head and start throwing grapes at a teacher ._.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYa i got some awards in middle school. Again, people ask me for answers, pretty ticked off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow im in high school.
