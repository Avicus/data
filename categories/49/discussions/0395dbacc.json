I just do it so I can look like I'm funny and chill guy. I dont know is it working or no. I find myself pretty communicative and approachable person even tho I dont look like I am. I can be very serious once its needed like during tournaments as player or ref, during scrims and sometimes in a normal talk but depends with who I talk to. I get mad easily but I dont show it too much cuz if you show your weakness some people might use it for their own good to annoy u shit ton and provocate you. Also sometimes i say some weird wise words and stuff like that beacuse its nice and sometimes helpful. I like to make memes with friends and screw around. As a player I think I'm somewhat decent but not amazing at all. I have the worse pc and setup in general on avicus probably and thats my only excuse. Playing with low fps during team fights and stuff like that is very hard and annoying but I'm used to that. I improved a bit but still not good enough and I think i can probably be better if i have decent setup. Idk what else to say about myself but I'm overall nice guy if u get to know me well and even if u dont but once u make me mad a lot I dont promise I will be nice, ill most likely be toxic towards u, sorry :(\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e{tag=9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383}\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy closest friend on avicus.

I just do it so I can look like I'm funny and chill guy. I dont know is it working or no. I find myself pretty communicative and approachable person even tho I dont look like I am. I can be very serious once its needed like during tournaments as player or ref, during scrims and sometimes in a normal talk but depends with who I talk to. I get mad easily but I dont show it too much cuz if you show your weakness some people might use it for their own good to annoy u shit ton and provocate you. Also sometimes i say some weird wise words and stuff like that beacuse its nice and sometimes helpful. I like to make memes with friends and screw around. As a player I think I'm somewhat decent but not amazing at all. I have the worse pc and setup in general on avicus probably and thats my only excuse. Playing with low fps during team fights and stuff like that is very hard and annoying but I'm used to that. I improved a bit but still not good enough and I think i can probably be better if i have decent setup. Idk what else to say about myself but I'm overall nice guy if u get to know me well and even if u dont but once u make me mad a lot I dont promise I will be nice, ill most likely be toxic towards u, sorry :(\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383?helm\u0026size=20\" class=\"m-0\"/\u003e \u003ca href=\"/users/Xuph.html\" style=\"color: #009396\"\u003eXuph\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy closest friend on avicus.
