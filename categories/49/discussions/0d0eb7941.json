Even if you can no longer start arguments in staff slack, you still have a tendency to get into them over the stupidest things on the forums and community slack. What are you trying to do? Further prove your immaturity? (Mr. James the Period Joke Maker, huh?) It's not even as if you have good arguments for anything anymore.

In Slack, you had a poor attitude that reeked of a superiority complex (which extended to the forums as well).

We no longer had to see the endless arguments that you started from thin air. We no longer had to deal with your superiority complex. I am glad that you left, and am slightly disappointed that you had not retired sooner. You claim that you are intelligent, yet refuse to provide even a sliver of evidence. Ever since you retired from the staff team, you have been quite vocal in criticizing it. It's as if you have amnesia; did you forget that you helped make the staff team what it is? Even if you can no longer start arguments in staff slack, you still have a tendency to get into them over the stupidest things on the forums and community slack. What are you trying to do? Further prove your immaturity? (Mr. James the Period Joke Maker, huh?) It's not even as if you have good arguments for anything anymore. You say you do not care about Avicus anymore, yet stalk the forums and community slack.
