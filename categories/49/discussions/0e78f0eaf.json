When u get older u will start to understand that. For now if u want to get into a good team and actually let them play u in a tm, u should start to focus on ur personality and training to become a better player.

What i want to say to u is that getting into a good team isnt all about the skill but its also about how u r as a person. Like if u stopped being really annoying to everyone on discord then im sure that they will see u as a better person. Tbh the reason why i didnt consider u to join squadcatt was because of ur personality rather than ur skill in the game. And also u r pretty advantageous when it comes to pvp since u have a low ping. I mean look at me i have like 300-400 ping to avicus and im still pretty good at the game. What im trying to say to u is that there r no shortcuts in life. When u get older u will start to understand that. For now if u want to get into a good team and actually let them play u in a tm, u should start to focus on ur personality and training to become a better player. Really im saying this because its not only like this in minecraft or avicus but also in rl and thats when it becomes really important. Just remember that results come through effort and definitely not shortcuts.","created_at":"2017/06/27 09:22:17 +0000","created_at_human":"June 27, 2017 at  9:06 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":374300,"unique_id":"374300-4191","author":{"id":320189,"username":"GITHANOS3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7a2f863f8ea948df97aa52089461e8dd?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"opinions?","body_tagged":"opinions?","created_at":"2017/06/26 15:51:50 +0000","created_at_human":"June 26, 2017 at  3:06 PM UTC"}},{"id":375147,"unique_id":"375147-3826","author":{"id":567946,"username":"X911yasuomain69X","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/0bae9bf2c89041509b3bffa60c58e75f?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"bump still looking for attention","body_tagged":"bump still looking for attention","created_at":"2017/07/04 10:54:33 +0000","created_at_human":"July  4, 2017 at 10:07 AM UTC"}]}
