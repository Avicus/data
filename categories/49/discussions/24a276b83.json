I've been around since MCZone was here, but I played on another account called miyashiroboyz. This was one of my friend's account that I shared with him. I found the server by looking in the server lists for a good Walls Server. I played with a few of my IRL friends who have moved away from Minecraft now. In case you wanted to know, their names are ThisDuckOnQuack and hell_no_808. I absolutely loved playing Sky Wars after I found the server and especially loved playing on the map with the village. On the other hand, I don't think I ever played any Nebula while Avicus was MCZone.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter MCZone was done, I found this server called Avicus. I decided to play Nebula and I fell in love with the game. I got to grow and experience the level of skill around me increase. Back then, nobody knew how to \"Ninja Bridge\" and people covered the monument to defend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI've come a long way as a person and a player and I have Avicus to thank for that. Surprisingly, making lots of forum posts and replies improved my grammar substantially and improved my level of diction compared to when I was first here.
