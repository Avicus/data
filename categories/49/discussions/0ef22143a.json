So I should probably start with what brought me here, I was watching MCFinest in 2012ish and I saw them playing walls which I thought was really cool so I went and watched a whole bunch of other videos about the walls and in the comments I saw this \"The server IP is wallsmc.com\" I mean it sounded legit so I joined and I played walls like everyday or so. Then I finally ran into the first staff member which was a Jr.Mod and it was MissCarmel and I remember she spawned in a horse... Yeah as horse for some girl who's horse got killed. I did what the normal 9-10 year old would do and said \"Can I have mod\" and she told me to go on the fourms which I did and they were very confusing at first. The first post I saw was with the title at \"OMG I KILLED FUNKY\" and I was saying like who the hell cares about funky and then I see he is the owner.. (oops?) Then I applied for a couple of clans, got denied because apparently a 0.4 kd isint good and I met a few people in TS who don't remember me. (Sunny, Emmy XxGamingFoxxX) and BAM I became a so-so active member on the fourms and its pretty fun to be here and be able to talk with everyone.
