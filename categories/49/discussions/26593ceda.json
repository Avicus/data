I am Pr0XM4A1. The game I play the most here on Avicus is Nebula. Nothing better than an intense pvp game to enjoy with friends am I right? I have been playing since MCZone (I still use the MCZone IP to connect). I have two different accounts, so that is why my playtimes are split. Anyways, I have been on Avicus for almost a year now and I have never actually visited and posted a forum here. Well I have decided to change my mind and be more active on the forums ;). I know the schedule of the server (based on game-play, rules, etc...) Just a quick think I would like to get out of the way is I know I am not the \"friendliest\" player (which I would love to change and I am doing my best to achieve that goal), but I would like to first get out of the way that I am sorry for offending anyone in games (if I had previously) and I would like to apologize for being disrespectful to the Mods. I know they are just doing their job and I am the pain that gets in the way ;).
