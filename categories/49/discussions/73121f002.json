Even though we've never won a tourney, I still think we've proven that we're not just a randy avicus team. In previous times, even though we may not have had as individually-skilled players as we do now, we were more successful because we played mostly for fun and listened to each other. We've been struggling a bit lately for a few different reasons IMO. First, we're in a rebuilding period where we're trialling new players and having different people leading after some people left (budah/lego) and others became inactive. Second, everyone has been getting really salty/mad during scrims and taking everything way too seriously, which fucks up our comms and generally ruins the mood.
