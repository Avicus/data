I'm 13, live in Quebec, Canada. I am of Armenian nationality (Middle-Eastern country, right next to Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Georgia). I don't have many interests but what's really fun for me right now is mainly computers and everything to do with technology. I also like karate, badminton and I used to play soccer as a goalkeeper but it got really depressing and competitive so I stopped. I've been an active member in the community for, I don't know, a little over 2 years now? Before that I just played the game, no interaction. I fell in love with this community and have been with it ever since.
