I'm that guy who never says the right thing at the right time and ends up being kicked in all typicality. You may even hate me. And I understand. There is a reason to hate me. I lose my cool very easily, which is, in the end, my downfall. Almost everything I do on Avicus soon merges into anger and gets me kicked. What is this anger caused by? A lack of cooperation. I express my dismay at this lack of cooperation from my teammates so often that soon, even I'm not cooperating. You are probably bored of reading this. I understand. You are probably against me. I understand. I am not a pessimist, but I hate myself. People tell me to lift my spirits up, I do, and I get labelled 'Cocky.' Which makes me hate myself even more. I play Minecraft as a way to let off steam, to forget my surroundings and endorse myself into a Magical world. The only problem is, when I do, reality catches up to me. Everybody is like they are in the real world. They are all trying to be noticed by going straight to the enemy's monument in an 'Oh so heroic' Fashion. I almost always stay behind attempting to preserve the Monument. It always ends like this: I am the only Player defending, 5 Enemies kill me and mine the Monument, I lose my cool and ask my team aggressively, \"Why didn't we cooperate you idiots?\" They say, \"You weren't cooperating either\" I rage, and I get kicked. As usual. I think, even after you reading all this, you still probably don't like me. I understand. After all. I can't play until February the 10th.

Listen, if you ever need to talk about anything, message me on skype. (JJTheGuy99) I'm really good at helping with your problems, and other stuff like that. Hating yourself... I hate myself too. \u0026nbsp;It's really damn hard for me to keep my cool in a world of complete idiots. I know fully where your coming from, but I'm here, and I know others are here if you need help.","created_at":"2016/01/13 15:53:43 +0000","created_at_human":"January 13, 2016 at  3:01 PM UTC"},{"id":270021,"unique_id":"270021-2956","author":{"id":243148,"username":"Thomas_Shoes","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5f511f185ef74c44970c60335aed1b83?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"You're a 100 pound 10 year old who tries to rap.\u003cbr\u003eSit down son :*","body_tagged":"You're a 100 pound 10 year old who tries to rap.\u003cbr\u003eSit down son :*","created_at":"2016/01/13 16:14:01 +0000","created_at_human":"January 13, 2016 at  4:01 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":270016,"unique_id":"270016-2792","author":{"id":11877,"username":"JJTheGuy","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/2d764d0c9489477b88f88dff713366ec?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Why don't you fucking leave","body_tagged":"Why don't you fucking leave","created_at":"2016/01/13 15:51:16 +0000","created_at_human":"January 13, 2016 at  3:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":270027,"unique_id":"270027-1382","author":{"id":11877,"username":"JJTheGuy","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/2d764d0c9489477b88f88dff713366ec?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Actually I'm a 15 year old 120 pound surfer who can rap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou're the ten year old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdit: Fuck off anyways Thomas, I'm being nice to this guy and you're being a dick.","body_tagged":"Actually I'm a 15 year old 120 pound surfer who can rap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou're the ten year old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdit: Fuck off anyways Thomas, I'm being nice to this guy and you're being a dick.","created_at":"2016/01/13 16:45:56 +0000","created_at_human":"January 13, 2016 at  4:01 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":270021,"unique_id":"270021-1700","author":{"id":243148,"username":"Thomas_Shoes","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5f511f185ef74c44970c60335aed1b83?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"You're a 100 pound 10 year old who tries to rap.\u003cbr\u003eSit down son :*","body_tagged":"You're a 100 pound 10 year old who tries to rap.\u003cbr\u003eSit down son :*","created_at":"2016/01/13 16:14:01 +0000","created_at_human":"January 13, 2016 at  4:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":270030,"unique_id":"270030-3831","author":{"id":7003,"username":"FrostedCupcakez","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3fd4ab1ed8eabd9cb07dcce0f64724b?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"@Thomas_Shoes \u0026amp; @AskMeToRap\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'm going to ask you two to stop this argument once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThomas, please refrain from being rude.
