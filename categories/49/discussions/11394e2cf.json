So I've never really taken part in the forums. I was thinking a week ago and i decided i would start being active on the forums! So i looked at the forums and saw all these AMAs so i decided to make one for myself! To try and introduce myself to the forums.Just some quick information about me, I joined during the phase when avicus had only walls or i believe sky wars. Those times were my favorite because i made a lot of friends and some of them still play today, after that i took a break until MC zone. I loved mc zone but a lot of the friends i made before where leaving some of them stayed and i was still happy with the server. I played seeing old friends go and making new friends. I remember my one friend who stayed with me the whole time, You all know him as Mucky( current IGN: Muckky)But my 1st major event happened when i made a staff app, it got denied and i sort of quit trying, not really too important but it was important to me. Then around a year ago i got banned.....then recently i got unbanned since i got unbanned I've sort of been taking a break. I will soon become active again and active on here too.
