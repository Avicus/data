Compare it to when every other administrator was around: there was much more of a push for progress. There were announcements constantly with changes, and it was a lot more smoother even with admins dipping in and out. The translation team ran by Posideon was the worst disaster I've seen on the server: they did little work, they were confused as to what to do, there were no regulation with them, and only now because Passively got a hold of it do we see that he opened applications and is a lot more open about it. I am also disappointed with how the prize pool money event happened, and each tournament gets worse. The competitive scene is dying and going to Stratus quite obviously, and nobody is working to see it as an actual competition between servers. Avicus needs to think about keeping its teams interested. Right now, without scrim servers, active developers, awful tournaments, lack of events, and the fact the officials are disorganized and even had to vote on enforcing a rule shows a bad spotlight for the server. We've also been damaged because of a post or two on /r/competitiveminecraft showcasing the disaster we had.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's summer, and we're supposed to be growing. We're dying. We had 3 months from the initial lifeboat announcement to OCN closing, and we did absolutely nothing to optimize the experience for the players to come here. We have wasted opportunity after opportunity and nothing will change that. We're being overshadowed by Stratus now, and they're even growing more with the development of a tournament scene. They have up to 80 players now and they organize scrims, the refs are organized, everything is amazing over there and the people are amazing. Meanwhile, a player will make the decision not to play Avicus. After all, why would you register over here when you can play on a server that outshines us in every way?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, slightly off topic, this server is completely demotivating. There's nothing to do here and essentially when I do something, after 3 years of trying to help, I feel demotivated because nothing will happen and I'm putting my work towards nothing. I have held up my end of the deal and with the staff problems and community problems, there's absolutely no point. I haven't really done any map development work other than build 2-3 maps the past month. Avicus isn't going \u003ci\u003eanywhere\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eOpinions on Avicus' Development?\u003c/b\u003e I am glad we got a new dev and that Keenan has been checking in the past few days more, but ultimately I don't think we're going to get much farther than we already are.
