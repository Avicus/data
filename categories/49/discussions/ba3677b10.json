I played for a while, and one day my friend, robocup1, introduced me to the server (he does not play anymore. This server was Avicus, believe it or not it was my first server. I still remember that one day when it was 7 PM and we called each other with our phones, the nostalgia is real... So anyways that day I played for about 4-5 hours, and instantly got addicted to SG, even though I was losing every game, and got 2 kills total in that whole time xD. After that, I started playing Nebula, and instantly started off amazingly with a bow, but I couldnt melee at ALL. After a while, I came across a server thats name is Famecraft, and this does not count as advertising since the server exploded... But anyways that was my first real community, and I spent a good 1 years on that server, until 1.7 came out, after that I came on Avicus mainly because of that lag. When OptiFine came out I went back on that server for about 5-7 months. After that, the server went bai bai, so I came to Avicus. There I made friends, and bacame prestige and so on.
