Which is kind of the most useless part of the Official Team.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eIf I was head Official first comes to the demotion process. Inactivity would go first. People who don't know what they are doing but are willing to learn would be salvageable. Either get rid of screen sharing or make sure every Official knows how to do it from the heart so they can do them as professional as possible. Make playing as an Official unallowed. This problem has gone on for way too long and it is crippling\u0026nbsp;the team. You have one Official and probably the most experienced one out of the group pissed when he has no help. Plus maps should be set on gameplay before they are announced and minor edits would be highly announced. I did hear there were last minute edits and do not know if they are true or not but you can't do that. The last thing would probably be the easy thing and that would be looking back at the last 5-6? tournaments and pinpointing everything that went wrong and why it went wrong. We then have plans to fix the mistakes if they happen in the future tournaments. You can't fix everything but well-prepared Officials look like the best officials. Then, of course, tournament day happens. I would\u0026nbsp;sadly do a DTM tournament for the fact that the community is built on it and is an easy tournament to test a new team on. It may not be the best for advertising but I rather learn out the kinks before tournament 2 where we do a great gamemode like DTC or something.
