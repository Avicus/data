I still find it pretty idiotic that you can't admit to using a kb mod back when Avi was 1.7, not that I really care anymore. No drama intended from that. We started talking and I like you now. I tend to like people who are a little bit toxic, which I do see you as, so yeah. Not like I particularly think poorly of you because of it, given how I've been acting as of late.","body_tagged":"Tbh I like you a fair bit, but for a while I found you annoying because of how Apollo members tend to act around one another (though most are fine as individuals imo), which is pretty poor tbh. I really just saw you change from TGC on and it dissapointed me at the time.

I like you as a person in-game, though we haven't talked too much outside of it. Your main flaw as a player is that your positioning can be too aggressive, which causes you to get punished a fair amount. You're a solid offender and I really don't know how you consistently come up with touches, but you do. Kinda carried Spectre in a few matches, just wish we could have been more active.","body_tagged":"You were fishy back then but like I didn't expect you to get banned off of like 30 seconds of evidence where some clips were slowed/repeated, I found that pretty dumb.
