In the morning, I usually wake up at seven and go to school at eight. School ends at 3:30 in the afternoon and I usually head straight to the library or nearest coffee shop to do homework and study. I spend a few hours there and get home at around seven or eight, and eat dinner.

First of all, realize that your grades do matter and don't make the same mistake as I did by fucking up your freshman year. People say that colleges don't care about your freshman grades, but that's not true. Public schools, such as the UC schools, only look at your 10-11 GPA, but your grades all matter. People like to stack up on AP classes because it makes them look smart, but that can hurt you more if you're not careful. If you're just doing it for the college credits, you can also self-study the subjects.

In middle school, I was used to getting everything done the night before it was due, or even that morning. That won't work for high school, especially since you're taking those AP classes. Manage your time wisely. For English classes, make sure you read the literature thoroughly and not Sparknote it the lunchtime before the exam.

School ends at 3:30 in the afternoon and I usually head straight to the library or nearest coffee shop to do homework and study. I spend a few hours there and get home at around seven or eight, and eat dinner. Then I'm left with a few hours to do whatever I want, and I usually use this time to practice music or work on programming stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'm gonna assume you're an incoming freshman. First of all, realize that your grades do matter and don't make the same mistake as I did by fucking up your freshman year. People say that colleges don't care about your freshman grades, but that's not true. Public schools, such as the UC schools, only look at your 10-11 GPA, but your grades all matter. People like to stack up on AP classes because it makes them look smart, but that can hurt you more if you're not careful. If you're just doing it for the college credits, you can also self-study the subjects. I self-studied six AP tests in my junior year and I found it much less time consuming than having to take an actual course, and I actually scored higher than my friends who took the class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond thing is don't procrastinate. In middle school, I was used to getting everything done the night before it was due, or even that morning. That won't work for high school, especially since you're taking those AP classes. Manage your time wisely. For English classes, make sure you read the literature thoroughly and not Sparknote it the lunchtime before the exam. For math and science classes, make sure you actually understand the content and not just memorize formulas and facts. KhanAcademy is a great resource if you ever get stuck on something or just need further clarification.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you're like me and can't concentrate at home because of siblings and parents watching TV, do homework everyday after school at a coffee shop. It's a really chill environment and usually has fast wifi, and if you go there often enough and have a membership they'll usually let you get unlimited refills.

My teacher for AP Statistics didn't teach at all though, so I basically self-studied that as well. I don't recommend trying to teach yourself Calculus BC since I started in September, but if you're really interested in math and are willing to devote a lot of time to it, then go for it. For Physics, make sure you fully understand concepts and not just memorize equations.
