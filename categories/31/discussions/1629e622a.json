What is your username in minecraft and what is your favorite game on Avicus?\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n Alright. Im sure plenty of you are wondering where I got my name. So, ill let you in on it. The short story is, it's my name and I liked the numbers. But the real story is, it's my name (obvi) but the numbers came from the numbers of my step brother's old account for a game he used to play, (can't remember the game exactly) so I kinda sorta stole the numbers from the end of that account and tossed them in to my Minecraft username, thus creating Jake41901. My favorite game is Elimination, although it isn't played often. During McZone we had a clan called the RaGe clan in the Hunger games, and it was a lot of fun. \r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e2. What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n Im really in to football at the moment. I just love the feeling of running down field and the adrenaline you get. I'm really in to dubstep, but I also like Imagine Dragons, Daughtry, and 3 Doors Down for music that I listen to. Music that thumps, I guess. Hanging out with friends as much as possible before school starts, and just having a good time.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e3. Where are you from?\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n I was born and raised in Maine, and currently live in Maine now. A lot of my family lives in Massachusetts, so I visit them all the time. So I consider myself to live in Massachusetts as well. However, a lot of people on the other side of the family live in Peru, including my mom who was born there. But, she lives here in the US now. \r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e4. Are you in school, or do you have a job?  \u003c/b\u003e                    \r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAt the moment I'm still enrolled in school. However, I often work with my dad fixing/cleaning grills, and painting. My grades aren't bad, but this year I'm striving to do better. Hopefully ill get average A's and B's all year. (Currently a Sophomore in high school.)\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e5. Who or what inspires you the most in your life?\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n My dad, by far. He signed to play for the Cincinatti Reds. (I think that's how you spell it.) He was never able to play however due to him throwing out his arm before spring training, and surgery was the end product. He described it to feel like someone tied a rope to his arm and tied the other end to a truck and drive off, when he threw out his arm. It's terrible to think about, but if he had never messed up his arm, he never would have met my mother, and I wouldn't be here. \r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e6. How do you contribute to the Avicus as a staff member? \u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWow... well, I try to contribute in every way possible. I try to help with maps (although I absolutely suck at building) I still like to know I helped. I always try to be inviting to everyone, greet everyone with a smile, and try to brighten their day. On top of that, Im here to help anyone. Thats why I made that \"Therapy Thread.\" If you ever have any problems or things you need to discuss, I'm always here for you. What we talk about stays between us, and that's that. And other than all of that, I Moderate. I try my best to catch hackers, griefers, etc... And I try to help other staff members in spotting something wrong. I just love to help people. That's why I applied for staff.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e7. What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating or managing? \u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nOh lord... Everything. But the most frequent... Probably these. \"HIIIII MOD CAN I B OP PLS\" Hey Mr.Mod, how do I apply for Mod?\" But a lot of times, it's this. More like a demand then a question. \"MOOOODDDD OMG OMG OMG HACKER BAN HIM NOW\" But it's okay. I knew that kind of stuff would occur when I applied, so I was prepared. I try to stay as calm, and collected as possible, and answer the question with accuracy. But I have gotten this once.. \"OMG MR MOD... CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH\" I got a little kick out of that. My response was \"-Jake\" He went crazy XD\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e8. Anything else you want to mention?\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWell, to any of you who decide they want to become a Moderator, it's amazing. Probably the best thing I do on Minecraft. Yeah it's a lot of work, but it's so worth it. The feelings you get from helping someone out are just priceless. It feels amazing. And some life advice. Live life to the absolute fullest. Do everything you can to enjoy yourself. Stay positive, and just have a good time. Positive mind leads to positive actions. And do NOT hesitate. Never. There's a saying \"hesitation hurts\" if you're going to do something, do it with confidence, and the mind set of \"I can.\" And lastly, I love you guys. \u0026lt;3","body_tagged":"\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e1.
