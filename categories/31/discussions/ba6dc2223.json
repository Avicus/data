Remember how everyone loved it so much? Well I have been thinking of a map design related to what Ravanged looked like. Does anyone know about Trench warfare? Well in WW1, soldiers dug deep,narrow holes in the ground, and basically did all their fighting from there. I thought that it would be cool if avicus had a WW1 themed map. Basically, the map would have two sides, the Allies, and the Axis. the two sides would be separated by a huge gap, filled with water. Then there will be the trenches. Each trench could have some sort of TNT cannon, and a chest full of red stone materials. The map would allow block placing, and the monuments could be placed in towers, or in underground trenches.. I just thought this would be a cool idea for the \u003cb\u003emap dev's\u003c/b\u003e to ponder upon!
