Use some blocks that match with each other, and others, not so much. Just remember, add variety. And use some secret blocks like \"33:6\" or \"44:3\". However don't make it too big, or too small, (Note: Don't make the radius of corn too big either). Congratulations! You're almost done with corn, Add some more detail AROUND corn, to make it look good, and inside. Maybe some things flying in the air, such as an Air-Plane. And now, admire your work on Corn, one of the HARDEST parts of making an SG map.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Image Coming Soon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eDetail around Spawn / Corn:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003eSo now you've completed corn, however this isn't EVEN 1% of the map... So lets do the other. Depending on what you are starting with, a Flat world, or a Survival World, but you can work around both. So, lets get into building a building for example (You can find more detail in ~this post). Same as corn, make sure all routes in each direction (North, West, South, East) are even (Chest count, Tiering, etc.) \u003cu\u003eBUT\u003c/u\u003e, before you worry about that, do ALL the building first, this will help out a ton when you are making a route (Usually making a route, placing chests, comes at the end anyways). So getting back into the building topic. If you wish to build a \"modern\" map, you may use some quartz, wool, carpet, beacons, and other items that look fancy or are full out \"white\". As well, most modern maps usually have high buildings, or no buildings at all, they're just some sort of structure that you can go in, and do all that. When you make a \"Medieval\" map, you may use stone brick, wool, cobblestone, gravel, Spruce wood, Wood in general, etc. Usual \"Medieval\" structures, involve castles and old looking houses. Lets start with the house: So when building a house, make sure you do frames, where all the parts of your house are going to go, this will be helpful since you will not have to guess measurements and other sorts of things that may get in you way. So you've got your frame(s), lets get to \u003cu\u003esome\u003c/u\u003e detail, starting with some oak wood, make the floor. Next, Start making the roof, manage the roof, move around, the roof is the \"hardest\" part of the house, Notice I put \"hardest\" in quotation marks, this means its not exactly the hardest part, but it is one. Once the roof is basically done, add some detail (Make a simple roof layout and then add detail). Nice! detail on the roof is done! Alright, lets get to the front door, and other walls. So you got your frame, and your house is empty, start by filling cobblestone between frames. Once that's done, make some holes for 'Glass_Pane_Item'. This will be your window. Once done, place the glass panes in the holes. And as usual add detail around the house, (On the walls, plant some wheat, and other crops). You may definitely copy and paste houses, if you are [1] Person, working on a map, making each individual house will be difficult, so copy pasting is not a bad option.
