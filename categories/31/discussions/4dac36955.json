We're looking into other options and for now I'll ask everyone to please be patient as we try to sort this issue out \u0026lt;3 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n- Admins\r\n\r\n\u003cul class=\"pager\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"previous disabled\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003e\u003cspan aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e←\u003c/span\u003e  Previous Update\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"next disabled\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eNext Update \u003cspan aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e→\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \u003c/ul\u003e","created_at":"2016/09/27 10:41:17 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at 10:09 AM UTC","title":"Ω Community Update (27th September) Ω","replies":[{"id":336697,"unique_id":"336697-4514","author":{"id":301959,"username":"LFT","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5b700f637ff4400689b73fc21f61239c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Neat","body_tagged":"Neat","created_at":"2016/09/27 10:45:51 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at 10:09 AM UTC"},{"id":336698,"unique_id":"336698-3782","author":{"id":310662,"username":"DaFrozenBlaze","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6fb20a2427f9448d8a77e460c5717481?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Yay","body_tagged":"Yay","created_at":"2016/09/27 11:26:40 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at 11:09 AM UTC"},{"id":336700,"unique_id":"336700-2617","author":{"id":70509,"username":"Tarheelkiwi","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/200fddcac10d814c548e2864041d5d42?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Buttons are a nice touch","body_tagged":"Buttons are a nice touch","created_at":"2016/09/27 11:54:34 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at 11:09 AM UTC"},{"id":336701,"unique_id":"336701-2340","author":{"id":18535,"username":"Goodnighht","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/18056f6655144dec9cb885d052e1d54c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"neato","body_tagged":"neato","created_at":"2016/09/27 12:03:19 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at 12:09 PM UTC"},{"id":336702,"unique_id":"336702-1585","author":{"id":150062,"username":"cellish","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/50a34639abb34cf1b182204756c49f49?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#2980b9","staff":true},"body":"Wuwhuuww","body_tagged":"Wuwhuuww","created_at":"2016/09/27 12:10:47 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at 12:09 PM UTC"},{"id":336706,"unique_id":"336706-359","author":{"id":237936,"username":"EncryptedShoesHD","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/bc592554bfc34c5993476bc1e46f58ea?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Neato :*","body_tagged":"Neato :*","created_at":"2016/09/27 13:07:00 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at  1:09 PM UTC"},{"id":336712,"unique_id":"336712-2184","author":{"id":533742,"username":"AbusiveUser","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66f36ed393614904831d2e100b7ad1d2?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Neato!","body_tagged":"Neato!","created_at":"2016/09/27 13:45:44 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at  1:09 PM UTC"},{"id":336733,"unique_id":"336733-2399","author":{"id":193218,"username":"ImRaging","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fb4900805ca04f6597ccf62d1468b193?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":true},"body":"'Rather have good gameplay than shit gameplay'\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein a community update\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003erly [REDACTED]","body_tagged":"'Rather have good gameplay than shit gameplay'\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein a community update\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003erly [REDACTED]","created_at":"2016/09/27 18:01:17 +0000","created_at_human":"September 27, 2016 at  6:09 PM UTC"},{"id":336734,"unique_id":"336734-1713","author":{"id":525724,"username":"Han_So_Hyun","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/decf6a0c8a7c4463b78165d050a39d7f?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"Cool!
