Yeah, your sense of humour may \"offend\" some people sometimes, but I thought it was rather funny and for that I like you ;D. Also, you're a really annoying guy when it comes to playing my youtube videos on tinychat, but it was really funny when you did to be honest xD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eGalaxyBrit\u003c/b\u003e - You were probably the most helpful staff members (to me) in my opinion. We both got Mod together, and Senior Mod together. I felt that I could really trust you with anything, and I really enjoyed talking to you ingame.

I had a great time talking to you on TS pretty much every day, and tinychat as well. All the screenshots you took of my butt whenever I stood up were.... interesting, especially the one where you edited a pigtail on it..

Cyanide, you honestly feel like a brother to me. I feel like I can talk to you about absolutely anything without being judged, and without me thinking that you're going to tell other people. You're trustworthy, hilarious, and a really amazing guy. You should keep up the great work as a Moderator, because you're doing a great job so far.

I want to thank you for being a really great friend to me, and a fun person to talk to. I always enjoyed talking to you on TS and on Skype since you can be pretty hilarious :D.

I know that some people say you were a bad Admin, but I don't see it. Let the haters hate you, and ignore them. I agree with Vlad when he says that you should somehow be involved with the staff team, since you have the experience. In addition to being just staff, I want to thank you for being a great friend to me back when you were Mod, Senior Mod, and Admin.
