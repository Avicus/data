Firstly, when a client says \"I attacked a player\" it sends an attack packet with the ID of the entity it attacked (say I attacked MasterGberry and his entity ID was 1304, I would literally send in networking language \"I attacked 1304\"). The server gets that packet and processes it on the next available tick (20 ticks per second, or TPS, when the server is doing well). When the server executes that attack, it literally makes sure I am within range of MasterGberry - if I am it validates the attack, if I'm not it doesn't.

Simple, because you know how when you send a packet to the server, so is every other player, sometimes sending 5-10 a second depending on what they are doing. The server has to execute every packet it has received on the next tick, IN ORDER OF RECEIVED. So when a server has 1k players on, it can have easily 3-4k packets per tick to execute. These take some time, and cause what Badlion Arena actually have - Delayed KB and hits. The reason is because the hits feel delayed because they can sometimes take up to an additional 50ms to execute because of all the packets the server has to process, which makes \"hit detection\" feel worse. This can make hits feel delayed and sometimes even get canceled, and also makes KB feel delayed because it gets applied later, and because of that the player who was hit has moved forward some which negates some of the KB making it look like he received less KB.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eWhy does PvP feel different in S13, and what is going to be done to fix it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eOk, before we even start this topic of networking and minecraft problems, we are going to go over some ground rules and definitions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eDelayed KB\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- When the server delays issuing KB to players for whatever reason.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eDelayed hits\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- When the server delays issuing \"hits\" to a player entity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eHit detection\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- Term people use to describe combat issues when they really don't know anything about minecraft mechanics and want to appear smart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eOk, so now that we have that out of our way, let's get right into basic minecraft/networking.

This can make hits feel delayed and sometimes even get canceled, and also makes KB feel delayed because it gets applied later, and because of that the player who was hit has moved forward some which negates some of the KB making it look like he received less KB.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e","created_at":"2016/09/04 17:19:37 +0000","created_at_human":"September  4, 2016 at  5:09 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":332891,"unique_id":"332891-3685","author":{"id":517510,"username":"Xuph","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"elaborate because right now it makes no sense","body_tagged":"elaborate because right now it makes no sense","created_at":"2016/09/04 17:13:54 +0000","created_at_human":"September  4, 2016 at  5:09 PM UTC"}},{"id":332895,"unique_id":"332895-3700","author":{"id":5141,"username":"Sevoo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/0f2408c6b4554076a115d9ea6c81a335?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"So if hit detection is real, what should I say to refer to it?","body_tagged":"So if hit detection is real, what should I say to refer to it?","created_at":"2016/09/04 17:51:57 +0000","created_at_human":"September  4, 2016 at  5:09 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":332892,"unique_id":"332892-1714","author":{"id":64970,"username":"Tazz","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/1c74c43029a0471fb30bcc2d9031ebcb?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eWhy does PvP feel different in S13, and what is going to be done to fix it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eOk, before we even start this topic of networking and minecraft problems, we are going to go over some ground rules and definitions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eDelayed KB\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- When the server delays issuing KB to players for whatever reason.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eDelayed hits\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- When the server delays issuing \"hits\" to a player entity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eHit detection\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- Term people use to describe combat issues when they really don't know anything about minecraft mechanics and want to appear smart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eOk, so now that we have that out of our way, let's get right into basic minecraft/networking.

Simple, because you know how when you send a packet to the server, so is every other player, sometimes sending 5-10 a second depending on what they are doing. The server has to execute every packet it has received on the next tick, IN ORDER OF RECEIVED. So when a server has 1k players on, it can have easily 3-4k packets per tick to execute. These take some time, and cause what Badlion Arena actually have - Delayed KB and hits. The reason is because the hits feel delayed because they can sometimes take up to an additional 50ms to execute because of all the packets the server has to process, which makes \"hit detection\" feel worse. This can make hits feel delayed and sometimes even get canceled, and also makes KB feel delayed because it gets applied later, and because of that the player who was hit has moved forward some which negates some of the KB making it look like he received less KB.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eWhy does PvP feel different in S13, and what is going to be done to fix it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eOk, before we even start this topic of networking and minecraft problems, we are going to go over some ground rules and definitions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eDelayed KB\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- When the server delays issuing KB to players for whatever reason.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eDelayed hits\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- When the server delays issuing \"hits\" to a player entity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eHit detection\u003c/u\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;- Term people use to describe combat issues when they really don't know anything about minecraft mechanics and want to appear smart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 63); font-family: \u0026quot;Open Sans\u0026quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"\u003eOk, so now that we have that out of our way, let's get right into basic minecraft/networking. Firstly, when a client says \"I attacked a player\" it sends an attack packet with the ID of the entity it attacked (say I attacked MasterGberry and his entity ID was 1304, I would literally send in networking language \"I attacked 1304\"). The server gets that packet and processes it on the next available tick (20 ticks per second, or TPS, when the server is doing well). When the server executes that attack, it literally makes sure I am within range of MasterGberry - if I am it validates the attack, if I'm not it doesn't. It does not check direction, it does not check if I was aiming, it does nothing other then check range.
