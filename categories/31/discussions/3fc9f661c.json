And with 3 devs it still isn't enough,they cannot fix the server lag, and they all have personal lives so they can't work 24/7 on the gamemodes. And to end off Ivy is the only person who can fix server lag (which hasn't really showed unless its timing out ever 3 hours). But Ivy has a life. From what I understand he is going to college/university next year so he can't dedicate 24/7 or even 12/7 since he has work to do. 11th and 12th grade are the most important grades of someones life since that is when they choose what career they will go through and live with the rest of their life. So please calm down and get suck in all of the info I put up there. The staff are not here to help with gamemodes, and server lag. They are here to prevent the community from breaking apart and for the server to die in a hole cause of hackers.","created_at":"2014/09/21 21:21:49 +0000","created_at_human":"September 21, 2014 at  9:09 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":88921,"unique_id":"88921-2743","author":{"id":70272,"username":"Polar_Express","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7041fe1f5d344373b6dc8a7d4605033b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"The problem is not that \" The staff\" knows about it - \"this is spam\".
