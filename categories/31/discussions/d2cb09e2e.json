Let me just list the reasons real quick.\u003cbr\u003e1) You only need one but people create plenty more on these \"special occasions\". I mean come on I'm sure not much has changed since the last time you answered the same generic questions asked each time.\u003cbr\u003e2) I don't even have to look at a single AMA topic to tell that people don't even post questions that allow them to \"get to know each other better\". Like you have to be joking. Asking \"Am I sexy\" or \"what's the circumference of the sun\" does not contribute to this whatsoever. I know it's an ask me everything but I just proved the above arguments completely invalid. So live with it.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e3) They take up space on the forums that could be used for other things such as helpful suggestions which this server DESPERATELY needs. If I have to open up the website and see some kids fifth AMA which he's making because he got banned from the server and wants as much attention as he could possibly digest at once then what's the point. We outlaw leaving posts for the same reason. So why should we even bother. I know it's for fun. I have more than one brain cell ladies and gentlemen. But just put it somewhere else.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in reality nobody would bat an eye at this post. Nothing will change. That's just the way it is. These posts are harmless but they're terrible in their own unique way. So for those of you who wish to argue with me, go right ahead. There is practically little to no benefit in AMAs.
