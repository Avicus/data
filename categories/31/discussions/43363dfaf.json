The whole point of even applying for staff is because you have the willingness to assist when needed, or even when you feel it's the right thing to do. You as a Moderator are a role model to the rest, in setting an example to be a well rounded player and to not break the rules.

There are interview sessions for Senior Moderators, so it is in a sense, quite difficult to achieve this position. However, moving back to the abilities: In accessing the support email, you are one of the very few people who can use the /appeal command in game, if a player has been punished and you feel they have the right to be \"off the hook\". However when you are appealed of a punishment, we usually think of that as your last chance. If you are punished again for a similar or more severe reason, you will most likely be banned permanently. Regarding the Web-Bans, this is used when a player(s) has accessed the forum and is abusing it in a variety of ways. (You can check on the rules to find out what those are) but that's basically the role of a Senior Moderator. You are also able to conduct Junior Moderator interviews.

The whole point of even applying for staff is because you have the willingness to assist when needed, or even when you feel it's the right thing to do. You as a Moderator are a role model to the rest, in setting an example to be a well rounded player and to not break the rules. You can also be chosen as a mentor for the upcoming or current Junior Moderators, to show them the ropes and what to do/not to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving along to \u003ci\u003eSenior Moderator\u003c/i\u003e, this is a higher rank which is much more difficult to achieve. As a Senior Moderator, you're entrusted with the ability to appeal infractions, perform web-bans, and have access to the support email. In order to achieve this rank, you must first have been a Moderator with at least 4 months of experience (at least that's the way it was when Jozz and I were Administrators) and be a highly efficient addition to the team with the willingness to work hard, and set the tone for the rest. There are interview sessions for Senior Moderators, so it is in a sense, quite difficult to achieve this position. However, moving back to the abilities: In accessing the support email, you are one of the very few people who can use the /appeal command in game, if a player has been punished and you feel they have the right to be \"off the hook\". However when you are appealed of a punishment, we usually think of that as your last chance. If you are punished again for a similar or more severe reason, you will most likely be banned permanently. Regarding the Web-Bans, this is used when a player(s) has accessed the forum and is abusing it in a variety of ways. (You can check on the rules to find out what those are) but that's basically the role of a Senior Moderator. You are also able to conduct Junior Moderator interviews. From applying for Junior Moderator being the interviewee, you are now the interviewer. You also have the ability to have a say in who gets promoted/demoted throughout the promotions and demotions process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[EDIT] And apparently a current staff member has corrected me in saying, there is no longer a divided Administration system.
