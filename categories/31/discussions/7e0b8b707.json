I'm best at bow because I've been playing Nebula and TF2 (in Minecraft) for so long, so I'm \"training\" to be better with swordplay by doing Soup. Hunger games mostly revolves around swordplay, but it requires you to be a bit smart in terms of hunger/inventory management, facing teams, and being aware of your surroundings in order to find/avoid players and keep yourself from getting lost. So play different minigames depending on the aspect you want to work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd btw, every opponent you face is practically a trainer, whether you shrek them or they shrek you.","created_at":"2014/07/02 19:01:29 +0000","created_at_human":"July  2, 2014 at  7:07 PM UTC"},{"id":30746,"unique_id":"30746-3039","author":{"id":11872,"username":"1Theodore1","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2872c11220b2ff66585675823fd98b51?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I don't really like \"training\" others how to pvp, but I wouldn't mind giving you some tips :)","body_tagged":"I don't really like \"training\" others how to pvp, but I wouldn't mind giving you some tips :)","created_at":"2014/07/02 19:11:51 +0000","created_at_human":"July  2, 2014 at  7:07 PM UTC"},{"id":30765,"unique_id":"30765-1183","author":{"id":39301,"username":"BmB","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9f0005b1de0845779cb51f70866c9bc9?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"If you think im viable for it i could give you a couple of tips and tricks. :)","body_tagged":"If you think im viable for it i could give you a couple of tips and tricks. :)","created_at":"2014/07/02 19:26:02 +0000","created_at_human":"July  2, 2014 at  7:07 PM UTC"},{"id":30812,"unique_id":"30812-817","author":{"id":203096,"username":"XTREMPANDA","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/119be4f1675c4f208b5bebc73941e8d5?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I can do more than teach you.. if you know what I mean :|]]]]]]]]]]","body_tagged":"I can do more than teach you.. if you know what I mean :|]]]]]]]]]]","created_at":"2014/07/02 20:37:11 +0000","created_at_human":"July  2, 2014 at  8:07 PM UTC"},{"id":30818,"unique_id":"30818-3523","author":{"id":108,"username":"MLGtino","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5855cb2b462f42969c1e685db0ecd987?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I can show you the basics of souping (hotkeying, basic combos, jittering, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept I think you already know them, I have no patience, and I'm over 5000 miles from my computer.","body_tagged":"I can show you the basics of souping (hotkeying, basic combos, jittering, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept I think you already know them, I have no patience, and I'm over 5000 miles from my computer.","created_at":"2014/07/02 20:42:22 +0000","created_at_human":"July  2, 2014 at  8:07 PM UTC"},{"id":30881,"unique_id":"30881-1638","author":{"id":66942,"username":"TheMasterClock","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/398fb956587f4ec7ac8d9474648022de?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"I am not good at training people but I can give PvP tips.\u003cbr\u003eAlso you can practice with 1v1s.","body_tagged":"I am not good at training people but I can give PvP tips.\u003cbr\u003eAlso you can practice with 1v1s.","created_at":"2014/07/02 22:03:44 +0000","created_at_human":"July  2, 2014 at 10:07 PM UTC"},{"id":30883,"unique_id":"30883-2747","author":{"id":344837,"username":"Swagdreas","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/092cee94e55d480d9a7125b37fe648f2?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"It was very easy for me to train myself.
