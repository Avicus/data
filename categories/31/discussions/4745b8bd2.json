So the other day I retired from Admin. Not everyone knows my reasons for leaving, and since I imagine most people have made their own guesses by now, let's clear up the confusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess the biggest one that I've heard is that I retired because of something going on with the Admins, or something that I didn't agree with in the Admin team. To debunk this in the simplest way possible, I'm the sort of person that when faced with a problem in my work space, I work to fix it. Retiring for that reason would have been, in my opinion a waste of an opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond most common guess I've heard is kind of related to the first. I did not retire because of any one individual in an Administrative position. While there were definitely things I didn't like, it wouldn't cause me to retire - it goes back to the whole thing about how I like to fix the issues, plus it's not like you can't put your foot down and argue with reason and logic against something that has none.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now that those two have been debunked, here's the real reason I retired. I've been on the Senior team since November. It started getting to a point a few weeks ago, where I started not enjoying spending countless hours resolving issues, maintaining internal services, and working on new projects. I kept the idea of retiring at the end of the summer in the back of my mind. Then the offer of Admin fell on the table, and I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I figured I'd just take the position and see what comes from that. Now we're at that last few weeks of summer and I still feel like I wasn't enjoying my job as much as I did a few months ago. My first year of University starts in a few weeks, and with that comes a bunch of work and opportunities. I'd much rather be spending my time towards that sort of stuff, instead of Avicus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese sort of retiring posts typically have like a thank you to all the people who made a difference in my time here. Quite honestly, there's too many to count. If you left any positive effect on me, you know who you are. I will give a special shout-out to Greg for getting me to join the staff team, to Posighdun for making me want to come back and for working with me as my Admin bud for several months, and to Josh for spending countless hours helping me out with the projects I worked on - it really goes a long way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the Avicus staff team, I wish you the best of luck, I love you guys. To the community, I hope you can bear with them as they try their best to make this the best server to be a part of \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'll incorporate an AMA into this as well, if you'd like to ask any questions. I'll try my best with those opinion questions, but there's a good chance that if we never spoke, I won't have much to say about you.","body_tagged":"Alright. So the other day I retired from Admin.

At this point, you've dealt with so much shit that it's easy to see you're committed\u0026nbsp;to Avicus - otherwise you would have left ages ago. Originally I wanted to see how you'd do as a Mentor to see if you'd make a good fit for Sr, but I guess you never really ended up mentoring lol. And honestly, you make a \u003ci\u003egreat \u003c/i\u003efit as a Sr. I enjoyed getting to know you and to start working with you in the Sr team (and in the staff department).
