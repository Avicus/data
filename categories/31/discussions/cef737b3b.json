Favorite team on RMCT would definitely be Dixin Cider considering its the only team I've been on in RMCT :P. OCN teams is a trickier matter. I definitely have the most history overall with PureBlox, but Eclipse is just so delightful, and I'm gay for like half of the dudes on that team. I mean, I wouldn't really\u0026nbsp;leave Eclipse for PureBlox given the choice\u0026nbsp;so I guess you could say I like that one the most currently, but I do owe a ton to PureBlox considering they let me play my very first tournament and gave\u0026nbsp;me the chance to play competitively for the first time.\u0026nbsp;Although, I can say with certainty\u0026nbsp;my \u003cb\u003eleast \u003c/b\u003efavorite team was Airborn.","created_at":"2015/08/14 07:49:53 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at  7:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":218857,"unique_id":"218857-1155","author":{"id":408214,"username":"lgmatias","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7dcb1605a6414f6f99efea04278b6f7c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Wasn't on the registered tourney roster as I never confirmed iirc.","body_tagged":"Wasn't on the registered tourney roster as I never confirmed iirc.","created_at":"2015/08/14 08:28:23 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":218856,"unique_id":"218856-4126","author":{"id":414226,"username":"ksch","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6783ceeadc9845618ec0c39fec34c051?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"your first tourney was with the legendary team fortis you just didnt play technically x) you already lied on this thread gg demodded moderators not allowed to lie","body_tagged":"your first tourney was with the legendary team fortis you just didnt play technically x) you already lied on this thread gg demodded moderators not allowed to lie","created_at":"2015/08/14 08:25:42 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":218859,"unique_id":"218859-1707","author":{"id":414226,"username":"ksch","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6783ceeadc9845618ec0c39fec34c051?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"we gave you the chance to pay competitively first though x)","body_tagged":"we gave you the chance to pay competitively first though x)","created_at":"2015/08/14 08:32:29 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":218857,"unique_id":"218857-593","author":{"id":408214,"username":"lgmatias","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7dcb1605a6414f6f99efea04278b6f7c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Wasn't on the registered tourney roster as I never confirmed iirc.","body_tagged":"Wasn't on the registered tourney roster as I never confirmed iirc.","created_at":"2015/08/14 08:28:23 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":218871,"unique_id":"218871-2158","author":{"id":408214,"username":"lgmatias","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7dcb1605a6414f6f99efea04278b6f7c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"True","body_tagged":"True","created_at":"2015/08/14 10:09:27 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at 10:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":218859,"unique_id":"218859-876","author":{"id":414226,"username":"ksch","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6783ceeadc9845618ec0c39fec34c051?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"we gave you the chance to pay competitively first though x)","body_tagged":"we gave you the chance to pay competitively first though x)","created_at":"2015/08/14 08:32:29 +0000","created_at_human":"August 14, 2015 at  8:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":218928,"unique_id":"218928-3017","author":{"id":466365,"username":"ID10","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/68c0280d17d64c6bb453d1b8eb6a866d?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"What's another word that you came come up with that I haven't heard yet?
