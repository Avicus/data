Forcefield is superior in every way, but people often use this weaker hack instead because it's harder to spot and prove. The best way to tell if someone is using this hack or not is to see if they're hitting you while angled away from you or straight up facing another direction. You also get hit slightly faster than normally possible\u0026nbsp;by people using this hack. Note that click aimbots do not affect bow accuracy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eexample:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReAUacYF2-A\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReAUacYF2-A\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eBow Aimbot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eBow aimbots are\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003every\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003erare, so it's unlikely you'll run into someone using this hack. What it does is change the direction of the arrow as soon as it leaves your bow to hit the closest player or mob, allowing for impossible accuracy at long range. This hack is very hard\u0026nbsp;to prove, as some players are simply good shots or they get lucky. The only way to tell is if you see someone shooting an arrow sideways or even backwards. Sometimes you can catch them if their accuracy at a\u0026nbsp;very long range is simply inhuman, but it's unlikely that you will be able to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eexample:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDvRMIGaFqg\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDvRMIGaFqg\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eexample 2:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMAFgY1E9RQ\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMAFgY1E9RQ\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSpeedhacks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eSpeed hacks make a player able to move extremely fast, giving them an unfair advantage over other players.\u0026nbsp; If a player if moving monstrously fast, report them for speed hacking\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eexample:\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_15cTphMsw\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0026nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_15cTphMsw\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSprint Hacks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eSprint Hacks allows players to always be sprinting, regardless of if they are shifting, blocking with a sword, shooting a bow, or running into a block.\u0026nbsp; You can spot players with autosprint if they have sprint particles coming off while standing still.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eex\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003eample:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0va1FLzvKME\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0va1FLzvKME\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick Macro\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eThis hack allows players to put on all their armor at the same team, easily and fast.\u0026nbsp; It is used most in pot pvp, but players use it on Project Ares too.\u0026nbsp; You can tell if someone is using this hack if they put on 2 or more pieces of armor at the same time.\u0026nbsp; This hack can be used to do other things too\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFly-Hack\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eFly hacking makes players fly as though they are in creative mode.\u0026nbsp; nocheat+ makes it harder to flyhack, but players can still do it.\u0026nbsp; If you see a player as though they are in creative mode flying that isn't observer, report them immeditaley.\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003e(use /toggle obs to get rid of observers)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eexample:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4Q4NjEhAw\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4Q4NjEhAw\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eDerp Hacks\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDerp Mode is a hack that makes players movement completely flip out.
