To play on Avicus is a privileg and if you are always complaining, then just don't play on the server. If you want to contribute the server or if you make suggestions then is all okay. Maybe try to code a gamemode and sumbit it to Ivy? I respect your opinions and some of them are right, what I see. And this is mine and it would great if you do the same to me.

I think one way to fix this would be to remove the rule that keeps servers from starting if they ave less than four ppl to a team. You can get two players easy, one for each team, but waiting for eight players is \u0026nbsp;bit of a stretch. I understand that Avicus just can't make itself bigger, but I think it could do more connecting to the worldwide Minecraft community, kind of like OCN does, which is why they have so many players.","created_at":"2014/09/10 02:51:39 +0000","created_at_human":"September 10, 2014 at  2:09 AM UTC"},{"id":81251,"unique_id":"81251-1630","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Mineplex has over 120 staff members...","body_tagged":"Mineplex has over 120 staff members...","created_at":"2014/09/10 03:55:11 +0000","created_at_human":"September 10, 2014 at  3:09 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":81198,"unique_id":"81198-3839","author":{"id":347312,"username":"_Phyre","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40d193e564da54887a49bb1cc7e65dc6?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cb\u003e1.)\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eIvy needs to hire other people to do some jobs of coding for him.
