If he was brought back, the senior staff team let bygones be bygones, so I suggest you guys do the same. And if he's caught hacking again, he'll be demoted, no questions asked. Simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd going off of what Vlad was saying (kudos for saying what you did, Vlad), these immediate Sr. Staff promotions are really...annoying, for lack of a better word. While I do ardently believe that Peachy was/is a good staff member, it comes at the expense of the opportunities of others. I know when I was a moderator, I tried my hardest to become a senior after a few months (and naturally, that never happened, but I still tried :P). I'm sure the majority of the current moderator team is striving to do the same thing, but instead of giving them a chance, the Sr. staff just pull former members from out of nowhere and say \"Hey, want a free Sr. mod rank? It won't take any effort at all!\" The other moderators already put in a lot of effort as is, but all these efforts are pretty much in vain because the former members of the Sr. staff steal the spotlight. And I get it, these \"former members\" worked for their ranks back when they were Jr. mods and moderators, but then why is it that only certain ones immediately get Sr. while others have to start from scratch? It just doesn't seem right to me. The sooner this new rule that Arigenn is talking about gets implemented, the sooner this problem will be solved (hopefully, at least).","created_at":"2016/01/07 21:52:43 +0000","created_at_human":"January  7, 2016 at  9:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":267861,"unique_id":"267861-2132","author":{"id":250240,"username":"NolanDalton","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7f054339a0c347ba8fca0ab2074b7d82?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"wow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhat an original thread","body_tagged":"wow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhat an original thread","created_at":"2016/01/07 22:06:52 +0000","created_at_human":"January  7, 2016 at 10:01 PM UTC"},{"id":267863,"unique_id":"267863-4567","author":{"id":15863,"username":"Iron","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/20017ca515fe4708893563db33af58ef?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"i would type but my hands have carpal tunnel","body_tagged":"i would type but my hands have carpal tunnel","created_at":"2016/01/07 22:07:33 +0000","created_at_human":"January  7, 2016 at 10:01 PM UTC"},{"id":267865,"unique_id":"267865-2695","author":{"id":12361,"username":"zero9178","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7cd248ddc99e9e5314fb8b0cb2b886a?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":":^)","body_tagged":":^)","created_at":"2016/01/07 22:07:50 +0000","created_at_human":"January  7, 2016 at 10:01 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":267863,"unique_id":"267863-4978","author":{"id":15863,"username":"Iron","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/20017ca515fe4708893563db33af58ef?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"i would type but my hands have carpal tunnel","body_tagged":"i would type but my hands have carpal tunnel","created_at":"2016/01/07 22:07:33 +0000","created_at_human":"January  7, 2016 at 10:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":267868,"unique_id":"267868-4002","author":{"id":292963,"username":"FrozenSolstice","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/8bacbc710bf84a1fa8fa71453487cd89?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I'd say the staff have different problems in different areas, but I won't get into that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs some other Mods have said, we are trying to improve, and that's true.
