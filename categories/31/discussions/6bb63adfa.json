I know, many of you hate me for it, I can understand that, and its ok if you don't accept my apology, but I am truly sorry for it. I admit I am a bad looser, I can be really mean sometimes. I want to leave that behind and start over again. The amount of people that hates me on this server now, scares me. In every game I join, theres at least one person that dislikes me. The guys/girls (idk girls) I have been mean to know who they are. I am sorry for what I've done to you, and I wanna start over again. I'm the person thats a bad enemy and a kind friend.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I can be mean or scary, is because people piss me off. Not piss off, but make me mad. People call me eZ, bad, \"teach how to php kid\", kid etc every time I kill them. Thats what makes me angry. If people kill me and call me eZ, then I kill them and say the same, the blame is on me. Its not very easy for me to enjoy this server anymore. I have made like enemies with every \"popular\" player on this server (not everyone but whatever) and that makes everyone else support them no matter what. I mean, in the last weeks randys suddenly starts hating me, because I call \"popular\" players eZ. This is getting worse and worse now, I'm afraid I'm gonna end up getting permabanned for rudeness. .-. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts just, you are not making it easy for me. When many people is against you, and you catch em up one by one, you make enemies with everyone. That is starting, if it not already has started, to happen with me.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have realized this server has more community and friendship. People play here to have fun and have a great time, not to be the best. I am sort of like both. I want to be good, but at the same time enjoy it. People call me a no lifer, and \"its just a game, and you play it way too much\". Well, I don't, I guess I could call myself a good pvp'er, thats because I'm from the competitive part of minecraft. I am from the communities that competes to be the best. Thats why I am a bit cocky. I'm not cocky in general, but when people start saying I'm trash, and I know I'm better than them, it pisses me off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you can see it a bit from my perspective now, its not very easy for me to make friends on here, because of the reputation Ive gotten. I've heard people are concerned about me, and that REALLY scares me. I don't have any mental problems or anything, and I have a life if you were wondering. If I do something wrong, everyone hates me for it. People ignore me, hate me, talk shit to me and yea, I don't feel very appreciated on this server. People tell me to go kill myself, I'm not that stupid, and I don't get offended by it, but when people start saying that I should quit Avicus and stuff, it makes me sad. People think I am a bad person because of my reputation, so they don't give me a chance to prove I am kind. Thats why I want to start over again, before I actually will quit (I'm sure you wouldn't mind ;[).\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts not that I only have enemies, I have a lot of good friends on this server.
