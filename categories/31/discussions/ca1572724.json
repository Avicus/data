I have recently been demoted for \"leaking my staff warning I was given about 3 weeks ago\". This is not a post to take down the official team, or start a flame war, but to inform the community about what happened to one of the most reliable streamers. My staff warning was for toxicity and not following event staff policy. I'm going to start off with the leak. (One reason I am making a semi-deal out of this was because I really enjoyed my position, loved streaming matches and communicating in a different way with the community)\u003cbr id=\"null\"\u003e\u003cbr id=\"null\"\u003e\u003cbr id=\"null\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e-\u003cb\u003eLeaking my staff warning:\u003c/b\u003e I posted on the \"Avicus memes\" thread about my staff warning, not knowing this would be considered leaking. This was a warning given to me for something I needed to fix. I didn't see the problem with it, it's not like I'm leaking some HUGE classified information that the server can use, it only affects me, which is one reason why I was a little upset about this. They said \"leaking is leaking\" but in this case, I disagree. In my staff warning I wasn't told about not saying anything, and I had also talked about it in staff slack with some other staff members, and they didn't say anything about not mentioning it, so I mentioned it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e-My staff warning:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, even I can agree that I was a bit of a bitch in staff slack, I was a bit tired of people not listening to the community and not being able to express my opinion without getting a bunch of crap for it. One thing that pissed me off was that they told me I wasn't following the event staff policy. I was like wait, we have a policy? When I was promoted, basically it was here's your rank , welcome to slack. I found out last night that the policy was pinned in alerts in slack, last time it was posted was June 14, which was about 6-7 months ago. They didn't bother to post it again with Project Redemption, so how can you expect us to remember everything? Even if I was on the edge of demotion with my staff warning, after I was given that warning I'd like to say I cooled down a bit in slack. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eMy activity/contribution:\u003c/b\u003e Aside from all this, I was one of Avicus' few very active medias and was always willing to stream when needed. Nathy called me one of his most reliable streamers. I literally streamed all of Project Redemption that I didn't play in. I don't remember getting a thank you for streaming from any other official other than Nathy, like where's our respect? They get mad at me for saying \"I don't agree with a TDM match for finals for this tournament\", basically disagreeing with the officials decision, but we rarely get appreciation for what we do. On the other hand, there were a hand full of medias who didn't really do anything last tourney. Didn't stream, co-commentate, or fill out the sign up sheet. Why weren't they demoted?
