How do I start?...... For those of you who don't\r\nknow me very well, I will give you a little insight of my time on Avicus.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003co:p\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/o:p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eIt was a warm summer and a few of my friends and I decided\r\nthat we should make a Minecraft map since we had just gotten into PvP. We\r\nwanted it to be different from others and a gamemode that would stand out from\r\nany others like TDM or Capture The Flag. After many confused and bored faces,\r\nwe had come up with our idea and we began building. We decided that the map\r\nwould be high in the sky and hosted on islands..... And so Skywars was born.\r\nMany of you who were on McZone (Now known as Avicus) may remember a gamemode\r\ncalled Skywars. Yes, this was the gamemode. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003co:p\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/o:p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eOnce we had built the gamemode we played the map countless\r\ntimes within a small group of IRL friends but my friend JJtCool wanted to go\r\nbigger. He decided that he would put the gamemode onto a server called McZone\r\nwith the permission of a certain person called FunkyStudios (Now known as\r\nKylocode). This was soon implemented and proved to be a big hit on the server.\r\nSince the map was then put on the server, this encouraged to me start playing\r\non the server. I became a regular and I became familiar with the mods at the\r\ntime (No McZone veterans remain after I leave unfortunately). This map got more\r\nand more popular that FunkyStudios decided to host a tournament after we built\r\nSkywars 2.0. As there were 3 islands, there were 3 teams (The Creators, McZone\r\nStaff and YouTubers). This was one of my favourite minecraft memories. The teams\r\nconsisted of Myself, JJtCool, PINEAPPLE_SLAYER, W1NKILLER2 and hughsie1. The\r\nMcZone staff consisted of FunkyStudios, killerbye22, Shirokamii and\r\nBlackhawk6alpha. And finally the YouTubers consisted of Exploding_TNT,\r\nGameplayerHD, and some other people whose names escape me for the time\r\nbeing.... Anyways...... We won this tournament and life went on. I carried on\r\nplay McZone more until one of my friends and a certain Blackhawk6alpha\r\nsuggested that I apply for a staff position on the server.
