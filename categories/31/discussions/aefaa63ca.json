Anyone can lie in their interview, the same way anyone can lie in their applications. I tried to test faking in an interview, but I didn't make it that far. Now, I'm a realist, and I'll admit, I actually did lie in my application, and got to the reviewing part. To get to the main point since I have limited time,\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003ePeople lie in applications and interviews, it's almost impossible to tell if they're being real. Applications are an unlegit way of finding the good mods or trash mods.

First of all, this post is only about why applications are poor, and why they should be removed. A new process such as hand picking is a very good idea (suggested by turtles). Another way you could pick mods is by having a quick application stating your in game name and your \"1-10, how good do you think you are when it comes to being a mod?\" This way, you can see who's interested in a quick way. The only problem with the second process is that people will tryhard until they get mod, and then abuse their mod powers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there are any spelling/grammar mistakes, I apologize for having you go through it","created_at":"2014/09/29 22:32:18 +0000","created_at_human":"September 29, 2014 at 10:09 PM UTC"}},{"id":93702,"unique_id":"93702-3522","author":{"id":119545,"username":"Y0urm0m1","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/739cef1a2e8b482da8442ebed62d8b4d?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"YAS i agree.

From my *bloopydoopydoop* research, I found that avicus uses 5 of \"Intel Xeon E5-1650, 64GB DDR3 RAM, Unlimited @ 750Mb/s\", and that with that, they use ovh.com as their dedicated server hosting. That costs over $100 monthly, so, there's already $500. After that, there's also buycraft, which is like $25 monthly, adding to $525. Then there is that Avicus donation store getting the money. Now, the EULA, Avicus is going past it, way way past it, not giving a crap about it anymore, and my guess is the server makes $100 in atleast 4 days, making it enough for the server, and Ivy would also probably need the money for his college also...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEDIT: This isn't a bump, for those thinking \"Oh, don't bump an old topic\".
