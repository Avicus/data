I'll admit that I've seen him sometimes do wrong things in the past and recently but many other people have, this includes Admins, Senior Moderators, Moderators. Some things that have been hidden too but they're still staff members. Some others have done even worse than Para did and they have either got promoted or demoted. I'm not going to hide this but Para said that everyone in the senior staff team apart from Funky or Newcleus were abusing in-game too. He also mentioned and admitted that he did make a castle and pulled pigs around it but the rest of the senior staff team except the ones I said abused as well. Some seniors apparently claimed that 'they use to do it all the time' according to him. I trust his word and I'm not going to stop believing it. This isn't to shame the Senior Staff team at all (I hope it doesn't at least), instead it is meant to explain why Para's demotion is invalid.

It was my fault as an admin, sure, that I didn't deal with it, but when you get caught in the moment, it's something that's a struggle to understand the actual effect of what happened.
