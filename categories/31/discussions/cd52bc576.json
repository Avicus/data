I joined Avicus about a year ago, when Ducksfanwaterloo introduced me to the server and forums. At first, I mainly loved Avicus because of how great the community was, and how much support I was finally getting for my YouTube channel. I was instantly hooked to Avicus, therefore I stayed. In the first few months, I had already made tons of friends, and met many new people. Some of my first friends on Avicus (Excluding Ducks and Vlad) were CrafterPete1013, 99250, jozzmcozz (Fluenza_) and many others. These are the main people who I remember had a great impact on me when I first joined. I considered Pete my best friend that I met on Avicus, and we had a lot of good times, and created some amazing memories! 99250 was always a really good friend, and it always made me happy to see him and play with him. Fluey was one of my favourite moderators at that time, since he always seemed happy, had a great sense of humour, and just made me feel better when I had a bad day. Thanks to these guys (and a lot more), my time on the Avicus Network was amazing! As time passed, I started to want to do more for the community, which is why I did a giveaway, and tried to build a couple of maps with Vlad (Yes, we are terrible builders ;D). When the Avicore update came out, I was really excited to try out the 2 new gamemodes (Avicade and Nexus). Avicade was really fun for me, since I was always competing with the top Avicade players to see who would prestige first. Avicus just kept getting better, despite some of the problems that some users were bringing up on the forums. Now, in January, I applied for a Moderator position for the third time, and I was very excited to see that my application had been accepted. After I passed my interview, I was happy that I had finally moved on in the server, and finally got the chance to be like the moderators who made my first few months on Avicus amazing! Thanks to everyone for supporting me in the past year, and I'll never forget you all!

Failure is what makes us better, everytime you get denied, you're taking steps forwards, not backwards. People who try and try their hardest are the ones who usually come out successful. I know that the first time I got Mod was the first time I went for it, but after getting demoted I got a taste of what it's like, so take it from me, don't give up.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e- Cupcake1241\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, it's been a great long journey getting here. I joined Avicus about a year ago, when Ducksfanwaterloo introduced me to the server and forums. At first, I mainly loved Avicus because of how great the community was, and how much support I was finally getting for my YouTube channel. I was instantly hooked to Avicus, therefore I stayed. In the first few months, I had already made tons of friends, and met many new people. Some of my first friends on Avicus (Excluding Ducks and Vlad) were CrafterPete1013, 99250, jozzmcozz (Fluenza_) and many others. These are the main people who I remember had a great impact on me when I first joined. I considered Pete my best friend that I met on Avicus, and we had a lot of good times, and created some amazing memories! 99250 was always a really good friend, and it always made me happy to see him and play with him. Fluey was one of my favourite moderators at that time, since he always seemed happy, had a great sense of humour, and just made me feel better when I had a bad day. Thanks to these guys (and a lot more), my time on the Avicus Network was amazing! As time passed, I started to want to do more for the community, which is why I did a giveaway, and tried to build a couple of maps with Vlad (Yes, we are terrible builders ;D). When the Avicore update came out, I was really excited to try out the 2 new gamemodes (Avicade and Nexus). Avicade was really fun for me, since I was always competing with the top Avicade players to see who would prestige first. Avicus just kept getting better, despite some of the problems that some users were bringing up on the forums. Now, in January, I applied for a Moderator position for the third time, and I was very excited to see that my application had been accepted. After I passed my interview, I was happy that I had finally moved on in the server, and finally got the chance to be like the moderators who made my first few months on Avicus amazing! Thanks to everyone for supporting me in the past year, and I'll never forget you all! Much love! \u0026lt;3 :'D\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e-MLGPorky\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“This has been a long awaited goal for me to achieve and it has finally happened.

I just have to give my thanks to the community. You guys are the reason I still play. If you weren't here, I'd have left 8 months ago :0. Don't ever give up on Avicus, it's such a great server.
