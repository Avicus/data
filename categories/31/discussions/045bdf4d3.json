There are certain players that do not wish to see these types of things on the server. We do have closed off places for people to become a little more \"vulgar\" if they chose but because of how open the server platform is on Avicus we do not wish that these inappropriate skins, usernames, etc. on such a public place. Now I do believe that calling the server corrupt is unfair in this regard. \u0026nbsp;Whenever I search up the word \"corrupt,\"(Dictionary, 2016) I get this \"having or showing a willingness to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain.\" from almost every dictionary website I can find. I do not believe we are being dishonest. It says right in the rules to not use inappropriate skins or usernames. “B1. Your Minecraft username and skin must be appropriate for all ages. Objectionable usernames and skins will not be tolerated.”(Avicus, 2016) \u0026nbsp;I do also believe that everyone knows when you break the rules you will be punished and it even says on the punishing guidelines that are public to the community that it will earn the user a ban or temban depending on what the situation is.

The only thing you put down was stated above which I already went to and gave my opinion on that. I can tell you that staff like to verbal warn instead of /warn. So much that it is looked down upon in the staff team. I cannot give you proof on that because it would be considered leaking where it is said but if you go into a game and compare the amount of times a mod verbally warns instead of doing /warn, it just proves my point. Also verbally warning is not giving out an infraction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.7142857142857142;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003e\"A couple years ago in minecraft when players were given infractions it was because they were ruining the community and the other players gameplay.
