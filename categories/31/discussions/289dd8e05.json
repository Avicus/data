It would look a lot better tbh.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd some cobwebs or other things like mob spawners possibly :P\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe second one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRotate the middle instead of mirroring it\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive the spawn side more stuff, like a trench full of hostile mobs, some cobwebs and like a walled fortification\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI wouldn't follow through with the guy who said \"remove mountains, they're useless\". They're for decoration of the map and should be kept as such.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn fact, I'd suggest improving the mountains even, make them taller and like real-like mountains! No gameplay impact and it makes the map look 1000x better.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe third one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI don't know where to start on this one, it needs a lot of improvement but it's looks okay though. Perhaps going to Alex's build server we can improve the map together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e","created_at":"2017/01/15 18:34:35 +0000","created_at_human":"January 15, 2017 at  6:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":352944,"unique_id":"352944-3597","author":{"id":263841,"username":"Myv","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/68cfe240d81c46ae8a939e3eb5d71e3e?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#2980b9","staff":true},"body":"I have made a few maps now and these are a few things I have gathered from personal experience and feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUse interesting block palettes no matter what the gamemode is and have a unique layout that hasn't really been tried before, but make sure it is sustainable and works effectively depending on the gamemode you have chosen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlways make sure you have fair sides and make them fluid and easy to run through.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd unique spots and slightly hidden areas with potential bonuses so the users are more explorative, so to speak.
