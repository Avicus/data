These laws state that any wagering of properties that can be earned using hard currency may not be used to wager on any skill-based games/events. The issue with credits is that while they are pseudo-soft currency, real money can be spent to aid in the earning of them, which would put them in the real of a hard currency. With this is mind, we cannot (without abusing some shady loopholes and putting the server in potential legal risk) offer the possibility of wagering any form of property on any of our events/matches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSorry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/Minnesota/\" title=\"Link: http://gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/Minnesota/\"\u003ehttp://gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/Minnesota/\u003c/a\u003e","created_at":"2017/03/17 17:30:49 +0000","created_at_human":"March 17, 2017 at  5:03 PM UTC"}},{"id":362803,"unique_id":"362803-26","author":{"id":263841,"username":"Myv","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/68cfe240d81c46ae8a939e3eb5d71e3e?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#2980b9","staff":true},"body":"Have another sale for a while, maybe 50% off for a month.","body_tagged":"Have another sale for a while, maybe 50% off for a month.","created_at":"2017/03/17 19:29:30 +0000","created_at_human":"March 17, 2017 at  7:03 PM UTC"},{"id":362814,"unique_id":"362814-185","author":{"id":19112,"username":"Numberz_","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/e16d067223c74a02bd22965e38521c35?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Server is hosted near Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
