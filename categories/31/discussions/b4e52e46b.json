Overall, the goal of Manager is to take up some of the more community related jobs that Admins once held. We are working towards gearing Admins towards more Staff and Developmental work. As you would then guess, we would handle community work. So far I have hosted a Megascrim, co-hosting the walls tournament (thanks to Seth's amazing work!), and have given away a gold rank to the winner of a Robo UHC. Personally, I feel like with time the rank will strengthen and grow more obvious in its goal. As I know a lot of you highly doubt the efficiency of the rank, trust me. It really has improved the senior team. It has allowed us to recruit fresh mods and overall increase our work ethic, and just in general clean up our acts. So I say this, cast away your uncertainties and look ahead. As the present may seem uncertain, but the future sure is promising.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eRecent Bugs!\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Recently, the Dev team pushed out a new update.

Overall, the goal of Manager is to take up some of the more community related jobs that Admins once held. We are working towards gearing Admins towards more Staff and Developmental work. As you would then guess, we would handle community work. So far I have hosted a Megascrim, co-hosting the walls tournament (thanks to Seth's amazing work!), and have given away a gold rank to the winner of a Robo UHC. Personally, I feel like with time the rank will strengthen and grow more obvious in its goal. As I know a lot of you highly doubt the efficiency of the rank, trust me. It really has improved the senior team. It has allowed us to recruit fresh mods and overall increase our work ethic, and just in general clean up our acts. So I say this, cast away your uncertainties and look ahead. As the present may seem uncertain, but the future sure is promising.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eRecent Bugs!\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Recently, the Dev team pushed out a new update.
