Thanks :3\u003cbr\u003eI wish I had better math teachers so you wouldn't have to explain that to me, but unfortunately I don't :c\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, I made another theory on how to find it..\u003cbr\u003eWhat you do is you make your PvP KD 100% \u0026nbsp;and then make your KD a percentage relevant to that (Say your PvP KD is 4 and your KD is 3. 4=100% and 3=75%) in order to find the difference between the two KD's (amount of suicides). You will then subtract the KD from your PvP KD and the percentage you get is the percentage of your deaths that are suicides.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eKills: 60\u003cbr\u003eDeaths: 20\u003cbr\u003ePvP KD: 4\u003cbr\u003eKD: 3\u003cbr\u003eSuicides: 5\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4-3 (100%-75%)= 25%\u003cbr\u003e.25*20= 5 suicides\u003cbr\u003eSince you're taking your PvP KD KD without suicides and subtracting your KD KD with suicides, you're taking out both KD's and just leaving the suicides.\u003cbr\u003eSay x= KD, and y=suicides\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e(x-y)-x= suicides.\u003cbr\u003eI think I got it? Anyone agree?\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all the feedback, too, this is helping my math skills :D","created_at":"2014/07/25 00:15:50 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at 12:07 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":48368,"unique_id":"48368-86","author":{"id":5943,"username":"Zieno12345","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9748362c57f043d39bfda5e27a121c34?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I cross multiplied 1.8 (or 9/5) with the ratio","body_tagged":"I cross multiplied 1.8 (or 9/5) with the ratio","created_at":"2014/07/24 21:21:09 +0000","created_at_human":"July 24, 2014 at  9:07 PM UTC"}},{"id":48657,"unique_id":"48657-2056","author":{"id":252750,"username":"FLuroKiTTeh","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b38b48315d0d461cb7e009195ead06c5?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I got 248, I dunt think it worked :p","body_tagged":"I got 248, I dunt think it worked :p","created_at":"2014/07/25 02:31:35 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  2:07 AM UTC"},{"id":48674,"unique_id":"48674-1076","author":{"id":163667,"username":"goldenwalrus909","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d27d79b3a7444e15bc68cf75e9ebcb97?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Did you try my new thing? :3","body_tagged":"Did you try my new thing? :3","created_at":"2014/07/25 02:53:08 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  2:07 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":48657,"unique_id":"48657-728","author":{"id":252750,"username":"FLuroKiTTeh","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b38b48315d0d461cb7e009195ead06c5?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I got 248, I dunt think it worked :p","body_tagged":"I got 248, I dunt think it worked :p","created_at":"2014/07/25 02:31:35 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  2:07 AM UTC"}},{"id":48964,"unique_id":"48964-552","author":{"id":252750,"username":"FLuroKiTTeh","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b38b48315d0d461cb7e009195ead06c5?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Nu, not yet xP","body_tagged":"Nu, not yet xP","created_at":"2014/07/25 08:53:13 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  8:07 AM UTC"},{"id":48965,"unique_id":"48965-2255","author":{"id":252750,"username":"FLuroKiTTeh","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/b38b48315d0d461cb7e009195ead06c5?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"\u003cb\u003eI'll try tom\u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cb\u003eI'll try tom\u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e","created_at":"2014/07/25 08:53:40 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  8:07 AM UTC"},{"id":49202,"unique_id":"49202-2414","author":{"id":13772,"username":"obs1d1an","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fff87e7340964b86bf98c14b5dec3786?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"26 for killing me and target value 26","body_tagged":"26 for killing me and target value 26","created_at":"2014/07/25 16:00:43 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  4:07 PM UTC"},{"id":49204,"unique_id":"49204-4577","author":{"id":222281,"username":"OPTOBAT","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/502f7dcfb6d94f85a94b97a15b0c951c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"i stopped counting how many times I've killed myself because its usually from being glitched off when I'm trying to build!","body_tagged":"i stopped counting how many times I've killed myself because its usually from being glitched off when I'm trying to build!","created_at":"2014/07/25 16:01:21 +0000","created_at_human":"July 25, 2014 at  4:07 PM UTC"}]}
