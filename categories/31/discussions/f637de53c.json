Thank you Mr. Referee for showing that donors aren't appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e2. They went against their policies. Which in and of itself is misconduct. Making an exception for a team that cheated isn't exactly a good way to break policy.\u003cbr\u003e3. Then it will show that staff can break their rules, let cheaters get away with stuff, and face no punishment.\u003cbr\u003e4. I was not the best thing to happen to Avicus. Not by a long shot. It was in decline when I left. I'm pointing out the inconsistencies. Since I have left, there have been a few things that just don't make sense to me. So I either try to learn the full story or point out the problems. I understand that staff make mistakes, I was a Moderator at one point too. But I paid for my mistakes and took responsibility.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e5. The favortism is in the fact that the team clearly should have been disqualified, but wasn't. The officials are making a post about the reasoning behind their decision soon.","created_at":"2017/05/08 16:44:49 +0000","created_at_human":"May  8, 2017 at  4:05 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":368867,"unique_id":"368867-2314","author":{"id":404925,"username":"ImTheRealBakugo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/19453fe27ed94addba8a3788973aa873?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"First of all, it was your problem if you donated money.\u003cbr\u003eSecond, where is the negative behaviour?
