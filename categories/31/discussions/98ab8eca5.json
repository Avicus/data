After 5 seconds of a player moving in, the teamspeak chat explodes/is deleted/locked. The player who moved in is paired up with a member of who they invaded on server mapdev, and have to 1v1 them. Whoever wins, they get a medal rank on teamspeak. If the person who was invaded loses, they are banned from the teamspeak for 1 hour. If the person who lost wins, you are given your channel back.
