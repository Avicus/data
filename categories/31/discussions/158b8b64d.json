The behind-the-scenes work that goes into keeping the server in an reasonable state is a lot more work than I had ever expected. The dedication and work ethic of everyone on the senior staff team is genuinely admirable and incredible. Though at times it may seem like there isn't much being done to improve the server and its state, I can assure you that there is a lot more than meets the eye with regards to that.

Nevertheless I saw myself becoming more and more inactive in-game and on other platforms that I was already inactive on. It had come to the point where the only reason I'd log on was to scrim with my team. This may not seem too drastic but my logic behind taking the senior mod position was that I'd do my moderator tasks (being active in-game and making sure things are all good for example) as well as the senior mod tasks.

I knew if I did that I would lose all motivation to do anything. I saw no other option but to retire. I genuinely feel that it will allow me to enjoy my time playing the game again. I'll feel no restrictions. In the past month of being a senior mod I'd spend my time in-game worrying about what was on discord and spend my time on discord becoming frustrated at certain decisions made by certain people or the amount of messages I'd have to scroll through. It was dumb that I was letting that stuff frustrate me but it did. I know for a fact that there are many more current moderators that could take the task of senior mod and be a million times better with it than I ever could. I was a wasted place on the senior staff team so I decided to make room for someone more capable and fitting for the position.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI rated IRL stuff over Avicus and I'm not going to lie, I don't regret it.
