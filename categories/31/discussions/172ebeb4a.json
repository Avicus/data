I had my first trip when I was about a year old, so I honestly remember nothing about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow long have you been playing on Avicus?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore Avicus, I played on this community survival server that had a community much like Avicus, albeit a bit smaller. However, it was disbanded in 2012, and I was on the verge of quitting Minecraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined McZone around the time Skywars was around (my cousin andee88 showed me,) so if someone knows the date for that, that’d be great. Anyways, I would pop on from time to time to play Skywars, and it was really a blast of fun and joy. When Nexus came around, I remember my friends and I spending hours and hours playing on the most hectic team deathmatch minigame I could remember.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Nebula was what really set off my addiction. The concept of having to go to the other team’s side to break the monument, or just equipping myself with armor and facing three other teams in a crazy deathmatch - this was definitely the game for me. There were so many maps, so many things to do, so many different scenarios in just one game, and it was really the most fun I had since Skywars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Avicus came around, I was genuinely surprised. Since I wasn’t in the forums at that time, I didn’t know what was going on. Skywars was removed by then, and Nexus just stopped working. Avicade was a cool addition, but I was only able to play it so much until it suddenly became broken. The friends that brought me to McZone, or Avicus, I should say, slowly drifted away because of these changes. But I stayed, and I kept playing. I got my other friends into Avicus, and I started having tons of fun once again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, during school, my best friend showed me his stat page for Avicus. I didn’t even know Avicus had a website, but I was fascinated by the statistics that were presented in front of me. I decided to explore the website, and I found what really set off my Avicus experience - the forums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined the forums on April 30, 2014, with my first introductory thread having the title “Hello, humans.” Back then I was honestly a dumb kid who really wasn’t accustomed or familiar with the Internet. I would make spammy and unimportant topics that would quickly get pushed back to the 10th page of the forums. However, as I started seeing familiar faces from the forums and in-game, I quickly became friends with many people - probably because of my dumb and derpy attitude back then. As time progressed I became more familiar and friendly with everyone on the server, and I started becoming more and more active on both the server and forums, especially when summer rolled around. When Avicore was released and the website was updated, I became even more active and my activity skyrocketed. I started paying more attention to the forums, watching old friends go and new ones arriving, and playing minigames all the more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, I’m here, as a mod, aspiring to make the community a better place! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you would like to add?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just find it heartwarming that I’ve been able to be a part of such a fabulous and loving community, and never would I expect it to be from a Minecraft server.
