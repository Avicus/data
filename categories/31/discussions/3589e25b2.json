She won't eat anything unless she likes it or it's sweets, has her toys laying around everywhere in the house. Worst part. I'm on me laptop when I'm not allowed because when I'm allowed it's usually at 9 when I finish everything. Even then I only get like 20 min because it's late, no matter if it's on the weekend or not... guess who isn't allowing me? my dad. But back to the point, sister always trying to get me in trouble trying to see if I'm playing. So if ya see me randomly go afk in the middle of a game it's either my mom, dad or sister who is awlking around xd. And every now and then I still wonder why I help her and care for her when she needs help or I just get her an expensive gift on her birthday heh. Guess I'm just a good brother.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan't wait to turn 18!1!1!
