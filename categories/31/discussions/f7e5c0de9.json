On Saturday around 12:00 GMT, I was banned for the reason of 'Hacked Client' which expires in one week. The reason I am writing this is because I do not have a 'Hacked Client'. In fact, the only client I use is Optifine for 1.7.4. I am quite outraged at the fact that a player must of reported me for killing him/her a few times and a staff member must of banned me without an investigation taking place. I would be very greatful if my ban was pardoned and the possibility a staff member could watch me for a few days after that to prove to them I do not use a hacked client. Thank you for reading.","body_tagged":"Hello, I have been a user of Avicus for a long time now and have been there for MC zone Network.
