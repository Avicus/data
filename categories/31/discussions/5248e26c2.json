It's good to see there are still people who are willing to help Avicus back onto it's feet, that's awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI've read through all your points, and read almost every post on this thread and I can confirm that the admins are going to release the October monthly update (which will probably be the biggest update you will see) very soon, that will address most of your topics.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my ideas that I have is to make something very similar to Pavilion's \"developer suggestion box\" where the community can send in legitimate suggestions directly to the seniors, then the senior moderators would send out an email personally directed to you explaining if your suggestion has been rejected, processed or accepted.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can also revive the weekly discussions that Howsie started, where, there would be a topic that the seniors wish to discuss. From there, the whole thread would be dedicated to that topic and at the end of the week we can \u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eall \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003econclude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, the staff team is internally stable so it's time to direct and dedicate our attention to the community. That being said, the staff team isn't happy with the users who are just throwing insults towards us, so if that can stop this whole staff \u0026amp; community relationship improvement would greatly speed up.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again, Pie, and too all users who are assisting Avicus to improve from a community perspective with respect and constructiveness!","created_at":"2015/10/15 05:44:21 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2015 at  5:10 AM UTC"}},{"id":239880,"unique_id":"239880-252","author":{"id":381908,"username":"Vobaseball12","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/2e0d2afbde584222a95aad8ebfce1ee3?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Pretty much gone.","body_tagged":"Pretty much gone.","created_at":"2015/10/15 21:56:28 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2015 at  9:10 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":239741,"unique_id":"239741-1475","author":{"id":310662,"username":"DaFrozenBlaze","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6fb20a2427f9448d8a77e460c5717481?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Speaking of Pavilion, where is he?","body_tagged":"Speaking of Pavilion, where is he?","created_at":"2015/10/15 08:32:19 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2015 at  8:10 AM UTC"}},{"id":239957,"unique_id":"239957-2621","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Initially he went on a justified 2 week holiday.\u003cbr\u003eBut he never came back...","body_tagged":"Initially he went on a justified 2 week holiday.\u003cbr\u003eBut he never came back...","created_at":"2015/10/16 03:12:42 +0000","created_at_human":"October 16, 2015 at  3:10 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":239741,"unique_id":"239741-4931","author":{"id":310662,"username":"DaFrozenBlaze","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6fb20a2427f9448d8a77e460c5717481?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Speaking of Pavilion, where is he?","body_tagged":"Speaking of Pavilion, where is he?","created_at":"2015/10/15 08:32:19 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2015 at  8:10 AM UTC"}},{"id":240040,"unique_id":"240040-114","author":{"id":442127,"username":"shahmi","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fc486af2733e44999724efdf53530550?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"#PieZ4Mod\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut thanks Pie glad someone took a stand hopefully this all gets fixed.\u003cbr\u003eOnce I fix my laptop I will be more active on mc hope to see you all there","body_tagged":"#PieZ4Mod\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut thanks Pie glad someone took a stand hopefully this all gets fixed.\u003cbr\u003eOnce I fix my laptop I will be more active on mc hope to see you all there","created_at":"2015/10/16 11:34:30 +0000","created_at_human":"October 16, 2015 at 11:10 AM UTC"},{"id":240134,"unique_id":"240134-2243","author":{"id":192491,"username":"PieZ","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/408727ad9deed8682820a40290ffe516?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#006BD2","staff":true},"body":"I would like the thoughts of Sr mods for this also and mods.
