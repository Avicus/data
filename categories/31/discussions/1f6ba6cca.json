Forcefield AKA FF is blocked in most servers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eKillAura\u003c/b\u003e - This hack may differ a lot from client to client I have to admit, but tl;dr, it basically hits people for you. In the most popular recent hacked clients (1.7+), it focuses on one enemy, once he/she's done, it finds another one in your range. If it's a teammate (you can't kill teammates), it finds another enemy in your range (The range can vary from 2 blocks to 6, so technically reach hacks exist :P)","created_at":"2014/08/10 09:20:40 +0000","created_at_human":"August 10, 2014 at  9:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":60403,"unique_id":"60403-2043","author":{"id":205867,"username":"Notalgicular","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92baab75669e56d4cb069267fc63a72c?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"That was kinda our point..","body_tagged":"That was kinda our point..","created_at":"2014/08/10 09:24:17 +0000","created_at_human":"August 10, 2014 at  9:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":60400,"unique_id":"60400-1409","author":{"id":317175,"username":"Arachadonic","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9e449b182d894146ad543fb89c7c647d?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"And if you did a survey in my old community, they would agree with me since I learned it all from them.
