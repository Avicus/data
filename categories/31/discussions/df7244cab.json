So I thought of an idea of battle classes. For example, you have infantry men on the front lines, fighting the crap out of others, and at the same time trying to eat as many gaps as you can.

Their job is to make all the TNT and red stone contraptions, needed to make a successful victory for your team.\u003cbr\u003eDid you guys find this interesting? Any other cool classes?
