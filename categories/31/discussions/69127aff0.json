A couple of weeks ago I managed to see an exhibition of my favourite artist in London and it made me think.. what is my purpose here on this tiny speck in the universe :3. I'm not sure if many of you guys know this either but art is a HUGE part of my life. I will be having my very first exhibition in a local gallery in my village (EEEEK) so I've really got to concentrate on painting. I hope one day that I can make people feel the sense of wonder which I felt seeing my favourite artist's paintings.

This server has grown alongside me for a while now and I feel like I have reached a point where I am happy to say, \"this is me, leaving\". Keep in mind that not many people on other servers would feel this way. I am not happy because I now 'have a life', 'got away from online-bullies', 'have no more lag'.. no… I am happy leaving because I see that each day Avicus grows, filling with more and more beautiful people making the most out of their creativity and friendships, just like I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you everybody for making my experience here on Avicus incredible.
