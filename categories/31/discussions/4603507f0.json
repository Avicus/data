The reason it was removed, for now, is because monsters were spawning very erratically. Every time that either Mt.

I think when the height limits were lowered it caused a lot of people to lose interest in Walls. The skybases give Walls more options and allows people do have fun building skybases, or rushing. Personally, some of my favorite memories from Walls are from buidling skybases. They are fun to build, and they just overall add another layer to the game.","body_tagged":"+1 I like the idea.
