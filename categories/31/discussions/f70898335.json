Now a days, quintus has turned into a kill farm map. Where'd that come from? This is more like spawn kill farming, players can't escape the bounds of their spawn area, without getting pegged by swords, and have the constant dread about being killed rather than enjoying the game. Imagine you were a brand new person to the server and you were on the team being kill farmed. You would probably be really mad about what is going on, and confused as well. You would be like, I can't escape my spawn, players with full diamond are hitting me just as I step out of the protective shell of spawn. Wouldn't that just be annoying? Then imagine that player thinking of leaving the server, and never coming back again, because of the experience he/she just faced.\u0026nbsp;I'm quite pissed off that this is happening on avicus.
