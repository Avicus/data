This will regard any personal opinons about server, gameplay, etc. that is not supposed to be showed to the real forums. The staff can propose one or 2 people to staff on the forum. The staff team must watch carfully by in game, forums, or chat logs to see what he-she does in game without staff watching (staff can have a hide feature or something idk).

However, if Avicus does start using the hand-pick staff system, there should be standards on like how to be mod.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example. You can have an offical announcement saying the things THAT will help you be mod. This of course DOES NOT GUARANTEE TO HAVE AN OFFICAL STAFF POSITION. I would say\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Helping other players in game\u003cbr\u003e2. Being nice, calm, and mature in the community and in game\u003cbr\u003e3. Reporting other players in game and using the forums\u003cbr\u003e4. Following and purposely not break the rules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just some basic ways to only HELP you get mod. It does not guarantee a positon. These are things that wont help you get mod\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.Purposelly breaking the rules\u003cbr\u003e2. Not maintaing a calm and causually atmosphere\u003cbr\u003e3. Being immature in game and in chat\u003cbr\u003e4. Being friends with a mod and kissups to them\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your just being annoying \u0026nbsp;and being kissups, IT WONT AFFECT YOUR CHANCES OF BEING MOD. Actually, your decreasing your chanes of getting it. Now personally, i dont see anything wrong with tryharding to be mod. If they really want to help the community, do not hinder them but you should do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if they do kiss up to much, the mod can just tell them to stop if its bothersome to them because their kissups and they would do anything a mod says would do\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo conclude, the hand-picked system is a great system. ITs process is slow but the server can really benefit from this system. I think it should be mixed in a way. \u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eLike a person who wants to be mod sends a application but the people who applied will only be CONSIDERED to be a mod. Then, the hand-picked staff system comes in and see if their qualified enough. They will watch overthem constantly to see if they relly keep their word or not. OF course when choosing, they may choose other people that did not apply as well. That way, the people who did not apply still have a chance. The ones that do qualify have to go training, jr mod stuff, etc.. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e \u0026nbsp;This is my opinion in this and i would love to see this play well.
