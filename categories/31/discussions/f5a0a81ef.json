Map additions - very poor system in place for adding amps / content, correcting submitted maps , communicating about the map, adding the map to the server (testing) and removing maps that no longer play well. If we had a great system in place and all the game modes had fresh, playable content that the masses liked, you could focus on other things that would make the server even better.

Player feed back from in game: We have no feed back method to report from in-game about what maps we like, what game modes we like, what content we want to see, or anything that is definitive. Avicus needs real data to make things better and real systems to collect that data and use it in a positive way. - Are we going to add a game-mode because some people on the forums ( who have been on Avicus a while ) like? Or do you want to get feed back from the new player ( and the old) while they play? Yes. You will get much more data this way. You will have the answers to a lot of questions and will push the server up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Lag - feed back : This is something that is needed, do we know what lags certain maps? Whats the player total, block count, etc etc. The server needs some kind of feed back device so that the owner knows exactly when the server starts to lag. IF it needs to be a command in-game that a user initiates fine, If it needs to be automatic great, but there is noting worse than having a great game on a new map, \u0026nbsp;then you cant see your arrows anymore, or you see 4 people floating in air and everyone says - hacker, when its just server lag... How can these problems be solved without information?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Moderation - This is not something that I see as a big problem on Avicus , although a lot of time is going into it. Certain times of days we may not be able to get a mod, but for the most part I think we have enough mods and they do a great job. I had a hacker \u0026nbsp;\" attempted murder: me today, but the mod was there and banned him after my report in about 10 sec. Whatever your going to do in this area fine, but Know that it is already better than most servers...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Prestige / Reason to play - Folks We have got to have some kind of \"Draw\" to the server, the Prestige does a great thing, but we should really consider taking it to the next level. I am not going to place suggestions here, but this should be a thought on all the mods minds.. how do we keep the players coming back....
