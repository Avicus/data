I would like to request further information and advice\u0026nbsp;regarding the ban of the account Auzeru. Auzeru is my other account. I was informed that I was banned for speed hacking. I have photo proof that I wasn't hacking if you look at the times the screenshot was taken. The reason I moved as fast as I did was because I used the technique in which you run in a space that is 2 blocks high and mash the space bar in order to sprint jump extremely fast. It is a normal part of vanilla minecraft and has been since the addition of sprinting. I would like to hope that this is resolved soon, as I am a long time fan and player of the Avicus (or skywars ) server. Thank you in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Auzeru","body_tagged":"Hello there Avicus staff and users.
