There have been changes on Tab Completion, message enhancements, which now show the rank and team from which you PM someone, some cool color changes in chat, new staff commands and utilities such as report clicking, namehistory, and go enhancements, as well as new command aliases, global punishment messages, a new combat logging detector which sends automatic reports when caught, some trails changes, and particle changes. All of these have been within a very small span of time, and already have had a big impact on how Avicus runs. It's on a streak to be continued, so we'll absolutely see how things run from here on out, and for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/5/59/Grid_Boat.png?version=da07814013ed71301ef07fc43e17886d\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Recent Map Acceptances\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;\"\u003eThere have been some maps submitted to the server this week through our new program Trello, and the two maps accepted are Maisosen by ParaSpider and FlyHacks and Sketch Vapor by dilpickel.
