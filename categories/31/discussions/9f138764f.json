I've developed a method of moderation and administration that is like a government and police force. The moderators act like a police force standing by and occasionally engaging in conversation but only really stepping in when truly needed. And the admins will act like a constitutional republic where the admins create rules and the people decide on them and only the admins can overturn the opinion of the people while the senior mods act like swat teams and military only really stepping in incredibly urgent situations. This is just a theory on how i think administration and moderation should be implemented im not saying this should be implemented this is just my belief. keep in mind this is not just based off of my experience with avicus mods this is from my experience with moderators and admins on other servers along with this server","body_tagged":"so i've been thinking through the past several minutes and then i came up with a theory on how server running and control should be run.
