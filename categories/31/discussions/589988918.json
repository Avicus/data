You might be emotionally stable, and able to handle these jokes, and maybe your friends are too, but not everyone is. I don't know many of you personally, and I certainly don't know any of you well enough to know if you are depressed, but there's a point where you have to realize that some people come to Minecraft and video games in general to get away from the bullying at school, or at work, or where ever they may be.
