It has been almost 2 years since I started my Jr. Mod trial on this server and even with all the shit, I have come across I am happy about my time here. I was never someone who followed others so quickly or defend others if they messed up. From day one I became a huge pain in the ass for anyone that was a senior moderator or admin and I made some interesting friends in that time. I believe I helped turn the whole team upside down by teaching others that being independent\u0026nbsp;and having ideas wasn't harmful. By around May I got leaked information (leakers lol) that I was to be demoted for my behavior while blackmailing was happening in the senior team. So I did the common bitch move and retired before I could be demoted. While this happened one of the admins out of the worst admin team retired and Sessp came about. Also, say what you want about Sessp, he is terrible at communicating and his ideas are not the best sometimes but he was better than the spineless administrator team we had back then. Even if the admin with the bigger spine came later. I came back after being asked by multiple people and my course work and social life were intact enough to support this move. I became senior mod in a month and slowly did more as the time goes by. When Fouled became inactive during March I went to Sessp and said there was a need for another admin. Seth retired around this time and I guess I was next in line or something. Fouled came back and we worked hard for a while trying to figure out the advertisement and other issues that Brandon (K_R_Cord) helped out with a lot. Sadly I believe the person who got the most beating out of everyone in this server was Kord because when he was very focused on advertising. Things weren't communicated to him and it just made a huge mess. A month ago I got offered to start writing on a newspaper and I have been enjoying that a lot. In the end my love for Minecraft has been lowered to the point I started to not care for the server. I have seen the damage an inactive admin can do and I would not want to be one of those admins that were credited in doing nothing. I disagree with certain things this server is doing and agree with others. At this point, I do not know if the server will rise or fall, all I know is that certain things can't keep happening. There needs to be more communication coming out of the Owners to parts of the server that need it. Map Developers need to work together closer with each other and the community to know what the community wants and organize maps being built.
