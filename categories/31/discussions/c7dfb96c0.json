So, how will we fix this problem? \u003cb\u003eAdvertise Avicus!\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp;I know Avicus has a YouTube channel and it only has one video on it. I say the Sr. Mods and Admins should do a weekly or monthly show on that YouTube channel about Avicus news and what's going on on the server and when they get enough videos they will start showing up in people's recommended boxes and that will get us more players on the server so we can enjoy CTW and SG! That's my idea, what's yours?","created_at":"2015/04/09 22:51:10 +0000","created_at_human":"April  9, 2015 at 10:04 PM UTC"}]}
