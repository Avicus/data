The reason for this is because we do not want to be DQed again. I am very knowledgeable on the topic of ghost clients and therefore I was the main person screensharing Ingigo. We checked every single one of his mods in detail, and in fact, he uses 1.7.2 and there is literally no ghost clients for that version. We also checked all of his versions, and the only one that was in his Minecraft was 1.7.2 which was clean. All of this time, he was still on Avicus so therefore he could not have logged off to change anything. We made him type commands in Single Player, nothing, we checked his controls, nothing. We even checked his USBs to see if he ran his Minecraft off of a USB. The only possible ghost client he could be using is an injection client and no actual Avicus player has ever heard of one. Ingigo didn't even know why we checked his mods and shit, let alone could he be using a ghost client of that sort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, we checked his mouse program and all of the buttons were default which means he has no macros.
