I actually have this motherboard and so far it has held up well. The only downside you might encounter with it is that it doesn't have front USB 3.0 ports however it does have 2 on the back. I don't use any USB 3.0 devices so that's not a problem for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eMemory:\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003eKingston HyperX Fury Black 8GB\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eReally any RAM will do, Kingston is very good and in my opinion looks very good as well. 8GB is plenty for anything you will be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eStorage (HDD):\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003eWestern Digital Caviar Blue 1TB\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eYup, 1TB of space, it will take you quite a while to use it up.

However, if you want really really fast boot and loading times, you will want to get this. Your computer will be in the desktop in less than 5 seconds. Games like Skyrim and Fallout will have really short loading screens. It's perfectly fine if you don't want to spend the extra cash as it's not really necessary, but in my opinion, well worth it. If you don't buy it, the HDD will be more than enough however you will have to deal with slightly longer loading times.
