The officials had already started organising what I believe is a TDM and CTH style tourney which once again will attract more players, TDM is also an overlooked gamemode on Avicus, it also is easily compatible with a tournament bracket and scrim servers and everything else that comes with it.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStop whining about not getting your walls tournament and either play in the next tournament or don't, who knows there might be a walls tourney sometime but you have to know when to give up kid.","created_at":"2015/07/20 14:05:52 +0000","created_at_human":"July 20, 2015 at  2:07 PM UTC"}},{"id":210133,"unique_id":"210133-4810","author":{"id":206495,"username":"ClubberNugget","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c1099ab1feef8b4c0ab0a43ed3fc43f?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I meant, when two teams know where the items are, they will have to face each other with similar armor, which means the better team will win due to their skill, pvp and tactics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if they are competitive teams, if they die right after the ten minutes, that's their fault, they lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, i didn't know that, but we are talking about a tournament here, people wont be slacking off and messing around, they'll be trying to win, so walls not being competitive is irrelevant because the tournament will be competitive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell you can build traps during that time, build a base, you also have to split out who gets what secrets items, like: who gets the diamond chest plate, who gets the special sword, all that. \u0026nbsp;Different maps have completely different varieties, playing a match on Overworld isn't anywhere near the same as playing a match on Neirus, Vanilla or Tetris Swamp or many other maps\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk if you already have another planned, go ahead, its your place to choose not mine, i am just trying to say a walls tourney isn't a bad idea\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003epersonally id prefer a four team walls tourney compiled of rather two man teams or three man teams","body_tagged":"I meant, when two teams know where the items are, they will have to face each other with similar armor, which means the better team will win due to their skill, pvp and tactics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if they are competitive teams, if they die right after the ten minutes, that's their fault, they lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, i didn't know that, but we are talking about a tournament here, people wont be slacking off and messing around, they'll be trying to win, so walls not being competitive is irrelevant because the tournament will be competitive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell you can build traps during that time, build a base, you also have to split out who gets what secrets items, like: who gets the diamond chest plate, who gets the special sword, all that. \u0026nbsp;Different maps have completely different varieties, playing a match on Overworld isn't anywhere near the same as playing a match on Neirus, Vanilla or Tetris Swamp or many other maps\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk if you already have another planned, go ahead, its your place to choose not mine, i am just trying to say a walls tourney isn't a bad idea\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003epersonally id prefer a four team walls tourney compiled of rather two man teams or three man teams","created_at":"2015/07/21 14:50:56 +0000","created_at_human":"July 21, 2015 at  2:07 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":210105,"unique_id":"210105-4035","author":{"id":378816,"username":"badgg","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c913d72d7140d19b0bee41c5e2f72b45?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Your first statement...

I personally think\r\nthat the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve\r\nmuch strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t\r\nreally because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be\r\n1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have\r\nsomething in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make\r\nit DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.\r\nI talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament\r\nbecause it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play\r\nagainst PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the\r\nplayers that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers\r\nin Minecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eAlso I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini\r\nevent, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work\r\non the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls\r\nplayers don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple\r\nofficials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e@BmB\u003c/b\u003e Just want to\r\ncomment on a few of the things you’ve said on this topic. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Lets face it walls\r\nattracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a\r\nwalls tournament.

I’m sure if this was announced a bunch of teams that played in\r\nthe Nebula tournament would play in this one.

class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eOkay, so my opinion on this whole topic. I personally think\r\nthat the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve\r\nmuch strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t\r\nreally because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be\r\n1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have\r\nsomething in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make\r\nit DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.\r\nI talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament\r\nbecause it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play\r\nagainst PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the\r\nplayers that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers\r\nin Minecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eAlso I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini\r\nevent, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work\r\non the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls\r\nplayers don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple\r\nofficials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e@BmB\u003c/b\u003e Just want to\r\ncomment on a few of the things you’ve said on this topic. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Lets face it walls\r\nattracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a\r\nwalls tournament.

I’m sure if this was announced a bunch of teams that played in\r\nthe Nebula tournament would play in this one. Berzerk and Apollo would most\r\nlikely play that’s already 42 players; most other teams would join just for the\r\nchance of playing/winning.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Your argument\r\nliterally had no valid points, I could literally copy and paste your argument\r\nand replace walls with TDM/CTH and it would serve the same purpose. “\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eWalls is nothing like TDM or CTH, you don’t need to actually\r\nstrategize in those gamemodes, it’s something good PvPers are automatically\r\ngood at. In Walls you need to work as a team gather enough armour and gear\r\nwithin the 10 minute prep time.

I personally think\r\nthat the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve\r\nmuch strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t\r\nreally because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be\r\n1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have\r\nsomething in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make\r\nit DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.\r\nI talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament\r\nbecause it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play\r\nagainst PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the\r\nplayers that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers\r\nin Minecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eAlso I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini\r\nevent, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work\r\non the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls\r\nplayers don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple\r\nofficials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e@BmB\u003c/b\u003e Just want to\r\ncomment on a few of the things you’ve said on this topic. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Lets face it walls\r\nattracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a\r\nwalls tournament.

I’m sure if this was announced a bunch of teams that played in\r\nthe Nebula tournament would play in this one. Berzerk and Apollo would most\r\nlikely play that’s already 42 players; most other teams would join just for the\r\nchance of playing/winning.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Your argument\r\nliterally had no valid points, I could literally copy and paste your argument\r\nand replace walls with TDM/CTH and it would serve the same purpose. “\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eWalls is nothing like TDM or CTH, you don’t need to actually\r\nstrategize in those gamemodes, it’s something good PvPers are automatically\r\ngood at. In Walls you need to work as a team gather enough armour and gear\r\nwithin the 10 minute prep time. It gives you more chance for teamwork, sharing\r\nwith teammates, building traps, creating distractions or just simply a full on\r\nteam rush.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Clearly I don't want\r\na walls tournament and clearly you don't want a TDM tournament.\u0026nbsp;“\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eI know that both the above comments were directed towards\r\nJracer, but I think it applies for anyone on this topic.

class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eOkay, so my opinion on this whole topic. I personally think\r\nthat the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve\r\nmuch strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t\r\nreally because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be\r\n1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have\r\nsomething in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make\r\nit DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.\r\nI talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament\r\nbecause it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play\r\nagainst PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the\r\nplayers that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers\r\nin Minecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eAlso I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini\r\nevent, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work\r\non the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls\r\nplayers don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple\r\nofficials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e@BmB\u003c/b\u003e Just want to\r\ncomment on a few of the things you’ve said on this topic. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Lets face it walls\r\nattracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a\r\nwalls tournament.

I’m sure if this was announced a bunch of teams that played in\r\nthe Nebula tournament would play in this one. Berzerk and Apollo would most\r\nlikely play that’s already 42 players; most other teams would join just for the\r\nchance of playing/winning.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Your argument\r\nliterally had no valid points, I could literally copy and paste your argument\r\nand replace walls with TDM/CTH and it would serve the same purpose. “\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eWalls is nothing like TDM or CTH, you don’t need to actually\r\nstrategize in those gamemodes, it’s something good PvPers are automatically\r\ngood at. In Walls you need to work as a team gather enough armour and gear\r\nwithin the 10 minute prep time.

I personally think\r\nthat the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve\r\nmuch strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t\r\nreally because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be\r\n1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have\r\nsomething in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make\r\nit DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.\r\nI talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament\r\nbecause it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play\r\nagainst PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the\r\nplayers that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers\r\nin Minecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eAlso I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini\r\nevent, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work\r\non the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls\r\nplayers don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple\r\nofficials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e@BmB\u003c/b\u003e Just want to\r\ncomment on a few of the things you’ve said on this topic. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Lets face it walls\r\nattracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a\r\nwalls tournament.

I’m sure if this was announced a bunch of teams that played in\r\nthe Nebula tournament would play in this one.

class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eOkay, so my opinion on this whole topic. I personally think\r\nthat the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve\r\nmuch strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t\r\nreally because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be\r\n1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have\r\nsomething in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make\r\nit DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.\r\nI talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament\r\nbecause it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play\r\nagainst PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the\r\nplayers that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers\r\nin Minecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eAlso I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini\r\nevent, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work\r\non the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls\r\nplayers don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple\r\nofficials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e@BmB\u003c/b\u003e Just want to\r\ncomment on a few of the things you’ve said on this topic. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Lets face it walls\r\nattracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a\r\nwalls tournament. Oh wait that makes up 4 teams.\u0026nbsp;“ \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eWouldn’t that be the point of this event to get more players\r\nplaying Walls? I’m sure if this was announced a bunch of teams that played in\r\nthe Nebula tournament would play in this one. Berzerk and Apollo would most\r\nlikely play that’s already 42 players; most other teams would join just for the\r\nchance of playing/winning.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Your argument\r\nliterally had no valid points, I could literally copy and paste your argument\r\nand replace walls with TDM/CTH and it would serve the same purpose. “\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eWalls is nothing like TDM or CTH, you don’t need to actually\r\nstrategize in those gamemodes, it’s something good PvPers are automatically\r\ngood at. In Walls you need to work as a team gather enough armour and gear\r\nwithin the 10 minute prep time. It gives you more chance for teamwork, sharing\r\nwith teammates, building traps, creating distractions or just simply a full on\r\nteam rush.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"\u003e“Clearly I don't want\r\na walls tournament and clearly you don't want a TDM tournament.\u0026nbsp;“\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eI know that both the above comments were directed towards\r\nJracer, but I think it applies for anyone on this topic.

Plus, I rarely plays TDM and CTH, and i'm still supporting it as much as any TDM and CTH player would. TDM and CTH is fun, it may not be 'your type of game' but that doesn't mean that we can't have one. And at this point, I'd be a little frustrated if there was a walls tourney. So please, if you don't like the idea, just just stay out of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;\"\u003eOh look, it worked. \u0026nbsp;Michah's entire argument just with some words changed.
