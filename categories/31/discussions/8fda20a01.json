I am sending this out because if you follow the advice that I post in this letter, it will not only benefit you, but also the community. Also, I see many potential Admins, Mods, Sr Mods, etc who haven't been recognized, or shown their true potential. I want this to change. Understanding and applying what I say in this letter are not only the keys to becoming an Mod, Sr Mod, or even Admin, following these key points can help you be more successful at life in general. I am not editing this, because I don't really see the point in doing so. If you are smart enough to even have an opportunity to become an Admin, then you will figure out what I am saying.

I have been watching the Sr Mods closely ever since the opening of Avicus, and I have been doing my best to note down their qualities and problems. You have been chosen due to your outstanding performance with dealing to the community.

To be honest, there aren't words or a definite definition to describe your role in the server, its whatever you make of it. I took the words “Community Manager” and described it as being the link between the people and the Admins of the server, to keep the server calm, to help the people in need, and to ALWAYS look at everything through everyones perspective (I will go into how to do all of this later in this letter).
