So much so an admin got demoted By the seniors. In all honesty, this shouldn't happen att all. When Howsie, Gill and I were admins, only kylo could demote us... Which allowed structure and a sense of leadership. When you have seniors taking control of demotion power; it becomes a rotating mess (so many admins coming and going in a couple months span). If the seniors have an issue with an admin; they should confront kylo so it isn't disorganised... Because let's be honest, he is probably the only one at the moment who is organised. Instead of a team full of opinions (which are easily swayed by peer pressure) you have obe ultimate decision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eOrganisation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eSomewhat linked to leadership, but when someone is demoted, why give them a reassessment couple days later?? Then it isn't a demotion at all! Actually, if you are going to reassess; why not talk about it when they are demoted\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eEvents\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eSo where are the events? Not tournaments or official ran events, but rather teamspeak parties... Giveaways etc. The admins seem to be so focused on staff related work it doesn't seem like they are planning anything FOR the community.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003ePromotions\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eInexperience in the senior team at the moment is crazy - admins being promoted with barely any experience as a senior (which is mainly a reason for the disorganisation and amount of mistakes made... Because they ARE bot used to an demanding team based environment). Promoting seniors just because \"there is a space open\"... Really? Seems like the admins are treating the seniors like numbers, not people (my pov). Work on assessing each moderator on experience and hardwork (hence the senior in senior moderator)\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eMistakes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI could be hypocritical here, but at this point in time I feel like it's very important to admit mistakes. You can't continue hiding and running away from the community. If you demote someone incorrectly, admit it openly with confidence. Feel like an event was wrong in your part? Admit that it was a fail and that you'll work on it! I regret making some decisions in the past; some of which were demoting a few quality seniors over some SILLY complaints (I demoted a senior for playing too much runescape and giving senior work less of a priority (glitchy ily) - but I barely admitted in making the wrong choice (because it was). I admit that I could have been more competent and less defensive at times. See what I just did @admins? I openly admitted things!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003eSo the community can say \"well, they are aware of their mistakes\"!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is all, will probably add more...
