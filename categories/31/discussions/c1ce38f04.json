It would be a story if the mapdev warning were for something completely different like talking rudely to someone, but you did the\u0026nbsp;\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003eexact same fucking thing\u003c/u\u003e.

You enforce the rules and tell people the rules, yet you break it and expect nothing bad to occur!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarcasm if you don't get it\u003c/b\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the refs or streamers abusing their powers, they were only spectating correct? What's the issue that they look. If they decide not to leave, then cool for them, but don't go using your moderator powers to resolve your own personal issues. Not every team has a staff member that can kick people from scrims.\u003cbr\u003eWhat you should have done was go and get an Official/Senior Staff to get the person to leave, and whilst waiting, you get evidence that you were asking him/her to leave and him not doing anything, and then reporting him/her to one of the head officials to deal with him/her. Him abusing his power does not equate to you using your power to deal with another\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003estaff member\u003c/b\u003e abusing his/her powers.\u003cbr\u003eIt was not affecting you in any way that the person was spectating at that moment, so it probably didn't need to be dealt with instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, \u0026quot;Helvetica Neue\u0026quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e2. Kicking players from scrim servers instead of uninviting\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eIsn't there a way to uninvite single players? Just uninvite Remy, and when he comes back, you re-invite him. Again, not everyone has Mod powers, if they don't need to use it to solve the issue, then you don't either. If there is none, it was your teams fault for having a player play in a scrim who went afk midway through the game. If a tournament you won't have the comfort to kick your teammate to make room midway through the game.\u003cbr\u003eUsing community servers to do Megascrims is the stupidest idea. Reserve a Scrim server or don't do it at all. There is a reason that it's a community server, to allow them to play, not force them to stay out, which I have a feeling that the #1 reason could have applied\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e*Cough*\u003c/b\u003e Did you ever think of that ?\u003cb\u003e*Cough*\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain for kicking an afk guy in a megascrim, if it were the public server, there is no rule that doesn't allow you to go afk in community servers.

Poor behavior for a staff member\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWell seeing how you were kicking people in public servers for being afk, kicking other \u003cb\u003estaff members\u003c/b\u003e who are abusing their own powers and\u0026nbsp;not following rules that you were informed of and knew, I wouldn't call your behavior as a staff member a good one, nor one that I would like on my own staff team.\u003cbr\u003eI'm not going to buy the Austin propaganda since there have been a shit ton of arguments on the staff team, and it rarely comes to people being demoted. Avicus Seniors tend to not frown upon arguments that occur within the team. It has to be super big like causing a hate group against higher ups \u003cu\u003e(I'm not afraid of saying I led one as a media)\u003c/u\u003e so I'll rule it out myself.
