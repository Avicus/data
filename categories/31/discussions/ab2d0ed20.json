I spend the rest of my day (Atm it's 3:23pm) playing Avicus, then fall asleep at 11pm. Since I'm not in school, I have plenty of time to play Avicus, so I play on it everyday for several hour (let's say 6 hours a day). After a week, someone says \"Oh hey Prae!\". I say hello to them back, and we start to have a casual conversation. Several other people, as well as 2 moderators join in the conversation. Someone says \"Hey, as me on the forums!\" I reply \"Forums? What?\".. That's when I learn about the forums, sign up, then start posting. At first, I post a lot, due to excitement. There's some fun forum games that I happily participate in, as well as some AMAs. I see these AMAs and think \"You know, these are really cool.

People know who I am, because I post on the forums everyday, and I play on the servers everyday for several hours. This has happened for 1 month now. That's 30-31 days, 180+ hours of non-stop Avicus time. I could now be considered a \"Regular\".. but what if others disagree? Let's go further into this story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's now August 29th, a few days before I start school again. I started being less active on Avicus, but I still play 2-5 hours a day. I recently joined another server similar to Avicus, and learned that people from that server play here, and people here play there! I become active on that server as well, and some people there recognize me from Avicus. I start talking to people there, as well as people who only play on that server. Starting to become quite the social butterfly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack to the main story. 4 months later, staff applications open up. I've never moderated before, but it seems like it'd be really neat. At the same time, it seems rather stressful, so I don't bother applying. I hear about some good friends of mine applying, and I wish them good luck. We start to have a cute little discussion about it, and other people start to join in. This is what happens on Avicus. This is just your average game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point is, there's no exact science to it. As long as you regularly play on the servers, and enjoy playing on the servers, you can become well-known (as a regular) in just a couple months. If you've been playing on the servers for 1 year, 2 years, or even more, you can still be considered a regular.. It just depends on what you've done in the past, and what you do present day. Not everybody wants to be a regular, and not everybody is able to become one.

Let's go further into this story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's now August 29th, a few days before I start school again. I started being less active on Avicus, but I still play 2-5 hours a day. I recently joined another server similar to Avicus, and learned that people from that server play here, and people here play there! I become active on that server as well, and some people there recognize me from Avicus. I start talking to people there, as well as people who only play on that server. Starting to become quite the social butterfly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack to the main story. 4 months later, staff applications open up. I've never moderated before, but it seems like it'd be really neat. At the same time, it seems rather stressful, so I don't bother applying. I hear about some good friends of mine applying, and I wish them good luck. We start to have a cute little discussion about it, and other people start to join in. This is what happens on Avicus. This is just your average game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point is, there's no exact science to it. As long as you regularly play on the servers, and enjoy playing on the servers, you can become well-known (as a regular) in just a couple months. If you've been playing on the servers for 1 year, 2 years, or even more, you can still be considered a regular.. It just depends on what you've done in the past, and what you do present day. Not everybody wants to be a regular, and not everybody is able to become one. You don't need to be well known, or even \"popular\" to enjoy your time on the servers, which is all that you need to remember about this lengthy post.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex) Nobody is going to read through all of that lol","created_at":"2015/06/23 19:40:15 +0000","created_at_human":"June 23, 2015 at  7:06 PM UTC"},{"id":201202,"unique_id":"201202-1385","author":{"id":282985,"username":"Thomas_Shoe","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/81136111df74475aa82188ba54906490?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"...","body_tagged":"...","created_at":"2015/06/23 19:45:12 +0000","created_at_human":"June 23, 2015 at  7:06 PM UTC"},{"id":201205,"unique_id":"201205-3158","author":{"id":350385,"username":"MidnightBeats","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4a6a26357525203511d926fd7eb5803?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"immeasurable","body_tagged":"immeasurable","created_at":"2015/06/23 19:58:16 +0000","created_at_human":"June 23, 2015 at  7:06 PM UTC"},{"id":201218,"unique_id":"201218-1431","author":{"id":431,"username":"Spoookeh","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/54964b606ce749229a4c2b981d8c2ed7?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"It isn't really a measurable thing.

I spend the rest of my day (Atm it's 3:23pm) playing Avicus, then fall asleep at 11pm.

I say hello to them back, and we start to have a casual conversation. Several other people, as well as 2 moderators join in the conversation. Someone says \"Hey, as me on the forums!\" I reply \"Forums? What?\".. That's when I learn about the forums, sign up, then start posting. At first, I post a lot, due to excitement. There's some fun forum games that I happily participate in, as well as some AMAs. I see these AMAs and think \"You know, these are really cool.
