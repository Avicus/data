So then I decided to play a single player world. After about 20 seconds of playing the single player world, My screen came up with downloading terrain and about 2 minuites later It looked like I was at the avicus hub. I had not joined the server all I did was play in the single player world and then I was in the avicus hub. At first All I could see was particles from the command block clocks I was making then I walked around and saw the hub. I also tried to test a few commands to see what was happening. gamemode worked so I flew around but I also tried setblock and summon and neither worked. As I flew around the avicus hub It was very strange as although I could see the hub buildings and blocks I could no-clip through them. Also I could hit tab and see the\u0026nbsp;list of players in tab and I could see players in spawn except One was stood still The other was rinning Forward and getting teleport back and doing the exact same run then as I continued to fly they stopped doing that and then sometimes there were no players and sometimes there were 5. Not all of the avicus hub was fully loaded and my screen was flashing rapidly blue. I've never seen a glitch like this before I was using no mods/hacks when this happened. I could also use the items in my inventory I swited hubs to see if that would fix the problem I thought it did but It didn't but It did seem a bit more server like as I couldn't use commands once I had switched hubs. I could see all of avicus hub chat all of the ad and even normal player chat I tried to type out to people but it didn't work. I don't know how this happened or how this is possible as I have never heard of this happening before. So I had to use my phone.Also I'm still in this \"ghost hub\" So leave a comment If you know how to help or why this happening or if you want me\u0026nbsp;to try anything.","body_tagged":"So what happened was I was playing a game of Nexus then I got kicked because of an internet connection problem.
