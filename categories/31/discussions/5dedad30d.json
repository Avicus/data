The main issue is the height factor. The many skyways (I guess you would call them) in the mine and throughout the map make it very easy to fall and die unless you have the kit stomper. In this case stomper can be used as an extreme advantage. Lots of people are not level 32+ which means many people would not have access to stomper and can easily fall and die before the walls fall (given the skyways being thin and easy to fall off of). When the walls do fall, the map opens up to more skyways which lead to \"staircases\" that go down (because the mid is much lower than the mid), it is very easy to fall and die and takes a long time to get down while people with stomper can easily just jump down to the middle. Another thing is the advantage stompers have because the mid is so low. They could either build out or they could just wait till someone is near/below them and stomp them very easily (there's no really escaping this, giving people without stomper not much of a chance).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis map does look really cool but I don't think it makes for a very good walls map okay anyways","body_tagged":"I've only played this map a couple of times but I already know I do not like it at all.
