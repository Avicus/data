Did I deserve it? Yep. I wanted to make this topic to just simply talk about something I see often in-game when people ask about my demotion. I've always kinda not seen a reason to complain about decisions staff related by the upper staff. Sure, some people will always disagree but don't just disagree because you like the person demoted. I completely respect the decision of the admin team and whatever they feel is right for the network I would want to happen. The decision was valid and I understand what I did was wrong. For those who do not know why I was demoted, I'll come clean. I was demoted for \"Immaturity, bias, racism, sexism, and favoritism.\" Another thing about this guys... Whenever something happens to you like being demoted, don't just sit there and bitch and moan about it. Everything happens for a reason and can teach you a lesson. What I learned from my demotion is a strong one too. Treat people the way you want to be treated, even if joking. I have always found myself to be a caring person, I just always had to dig far into me find that side. I would always say rude and racist remarks on TS as a joke. Is it fine to say such things even if joking? No. Now obviously being demoted on a minecraft server is a very small one, but it's just a much larger scale of being kicked off a sports team or kicked out of your school. I take this as a small lesson but also a huge one. Don't let the bad things that happen to you win. My demotion is only temporary, however, it all depends on how I act on Avicus and if I make one mistake I can be perm demoted at any minute. If you wanted to know how I plan to deal with this, I only have one answer. I'm going to continue to show that I do love this network and that I do want to be a staff member, whether or not I get sr mod back or just mod.","body_tagged":"[Sorry about poor grammar at some parts, I typed this fast and just started to ramble off what was on my mind.]\u003cbr\u003e[I probably repeated myself 10000 times in this post, lol.]\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, yes, I was demoted.
