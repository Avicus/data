I'm not saying you ought to keep maps like Rapture or Titans which play simply horrible, to say the very least, but I don't really see much of a reason to edit Ternio now if it's been that way ever since Avicus was seemingly eternally stuck with the Christmas Lobby two years ago. I can understand if you attempt to fix Quintus, for obvious reasons, however other than that map, which seems to be generating quite a lot of controversy for a long time already, should be altered in any form, unless it's YML-wise features/enhancements, which are to my point of view very convenient in most cases and don't bring in any discrepancies between map developer and community member.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis being said, I would also like to point out how the Throwback rotation, and ever since it was addressed as MCZone rotation, is the one which gets played the most out of any rotation in the entire network. Sure, I think I get an idea as to why you could be trying to \"rearrange\" it, however, don't you think the rest of the servers need more attention than the one that gets played the \u003cu\u003emost\u003c/u\u003e? It seems to be that there's little to no complaints regarding the Throwback rotations. And usually, when complaints arise, I reckon you're experienced enough, as I've worked alongside you all for quite a long time, to raise up points in favor or against said complaints. Because not always points brought up by a single or a rather small group of people are the ones that will most likely benefit the entire community as to what concerns the changes that would happen if said request was taken care of without thinking of possible consequences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack to the point I raised before, I think you should employ more effort in attempting to shape-up what are other rotations, which I know you're working at, since you're handling the Map Reassessment, to hopefully get these to gain more popularity. You seem to be giving some sort of \"special treatment\" to the Throwback rotations, much to the displeasure of many community members who complain about their favorite maps being brushed off the board like they're ancient dust that no longer server any purpose for the sake of renewal and variety. Because if you haven't thought about it, keeping a small fragment of our maps for a nostalgic-only rotation is indeed variety itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what I think you should do is: refrain yourselves from editing any or as less Throwback-exclusive maps as you can. Only do so if it is urgently necessary, say, there's a whole thread with a salty array of miscellaneous regulars complaining about how Quintus' killfarming ruins their day in so many ways they can't even bother to list them all because of the anger that boils their blood until it becomes crimson smoke emitting from their ears. Focus more on editing/changing the maps that are on DTM rotations, or even the CTW ones, because trust me, some, if not all of the CTW maps need some serious rework. Again, I'm not one to talk since I hardly know enough about CTW maps and its compositions but if I recall correctly Robin brought up a zillion of points about how our choice of CTW maps was unamusing to say the least.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in other words, I don't think Throwback needs much re-work at all, so I don't really see why you keep editing its maps over and over.
