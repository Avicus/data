Lowering the cost significantly to $10, $20, and $30 is an easy fix but think about those that already bought a rank. They would probably be pissed that something they bought for $90 is now $60 less. The second option is adding two new ranks. This would need to be added carefully and both of these ranks would be lower than Gold. If this happens a lot of new options for the existing ranks needs to come around. The problem with that is we need better options for Diamond and we need them quick.

It should come as no shock to you all that purchases have been slow as of late. We as a team are brainstorming ways to get this number up again while also making it more appealing for users to buy ranks in the future. These includes adding more donor perks and making older ones better/more exclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003eWe do not discuss specific finances here but to be frank there is a minimum price needed each month to keep the network running and in some previous months (not going to give specific numbers) we have been below that line. We actively try to have sales and giveaways to give people a taste of ranks but the bottom line is that prices cannot be too low because we have a bare minimum that must be reached for us to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003eI get the points made in the OP that market fluctuations are something that needs to be closely monitored by the team and changes need to be made to go along with this flow. As I said above, the prices for ranks haven't been changed in a while. This isn't good and has caused us to drift away from the supply/demand curve of our community and others like ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003eI've looked around at a few servers' stores and have realized that our store has some of the highest prices out there. These definitely needs to change. The fear we face, as stated above, is that we do not hit that minimum. Now, as the OP said, lower prices means more purchases, which is true. We definitely need to look into price changes/sales for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003eThe other big issue is perks. Due to the minecraft EULA, we cannot provide nearly as many perks as to what we used to. This limits our possibilities for perks immensely. I would like to ask all of you whom are reading this what you all think some good perks would be. In the past, many perks have been suggested and either implemented or denied for various reasons such as lack of developer power. We now have more devs than we have in a while so that means we can do some more things in wider areas. So, what perks would YOU like to see?
