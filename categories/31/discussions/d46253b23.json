In fact, some of the staff can barely handle constructive criticism! Just because people comment on how you do your job does not mean you have to jump in and prove them wrong. Either admit that it's your fault or walk away. And may I remind you. Being staff is a JOB. If you can't do your job, you shouldn't be there. You should be ready to deal with the consequences because no matter how much people hate on you you just have to keep on rolling. If you can't do that, just leave because nobody wants you here. The bottom line is that this is a game and you're supposed to play the game and have fun without brewing up a fucking sandstorm of hatred.","created_at":"2015/03/19 21:07:34 +0000","created_at_human":"March 19, 2015 at  9:03 PM UTC"},{"id":166043,"unique_id":"166043-443","author":{"id":29453,"username":"Super_Fat_Man","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/992f596de933414d9a9419dd08305eb0?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Thank you for posting this.
