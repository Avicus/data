It's a pretty easy fix. All you do is move your forge mods out of the mods folder, delete the forge .jar file, and also the\u0026nbsp;forge profile.

Never use the latest from any version, since they are buggy and things like what you stated above happens. Afterwards just run the file, create a new MC file with the forge version and throw the mods back in your folder. It should work by then.","body_tagged":"I've had this problem before.
