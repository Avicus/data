I remember when walls had a few large groups of friends that would be on almost all the time, now that group has gotten very small. I know there could be many reasons for this, but I am thinking walls just needs some attention. It is the 2nd most played game mode, and has a very limited number of maps people like, ( 8 without jungle) even CTH has 9 maps, Nexus has 15 and nebula has many, many... in rotation. \u0026nbsp;So with that said, any info would be great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading","body_tagged":"Hey,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes anyone know when Avicus will have another map testing event?
