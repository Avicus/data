If Avicus Event staff prepares a good tournament, with a good map pool and a prize for the top teams, teams will get attracted to play. Lots of teams have a main server to play, but then they play the tournament that the competitive scenario brings to them. So porbably, we can't brin more players to play actively the server, but we can bring teams to play the tournaments.","created_at":"2017/10/15 09:36:52 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at  9:10 AM UTC"},{"id":382808,"unique_id":"382808-4965","author":{"id":229973,"username":"minertedtoad","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/6ca612efaae34e7082bf72566d101be8?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Have more throw back events","body_tagged":"Have more throw back events","created_at":"2017/10/15 11:08:37 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at 11:10 AM UTC"},{"id":382812,"unique_id":"382812-1424","author":{"id":446523,"username":"ogel","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/4a05be898b8b4dfe848edf6c42967c9a?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Try to revive avicus first","body_tagged":"Try to revive avicus first","created_at":"2017/10/15 14:19:58 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at  2:10 PM UTC"},{"id":382814,"unique_id":"382814-259","author":{"id":270551,"username":"zicuri","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/004e817d35fa47aeac7e4f37d70ed9ba?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"Fouled is on Badlion, it's a gg sorry guys","body_tagged":"Fouled is on Badlion, it's a gg sorry guys","created_at":"2017/10/15 15:50:54 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at  3:10 PM UTC"},{"id":382815,"unique_id":"382815-4630","author":{"id":517510,"username":"Xuph","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"hey if we make the tournaments 1v1 we can finally have 16 teams","body_tagged":"hey if we make the tournaments 1v1 we can finally have 16 teams","created_at":"2017/10/15 16:06:57 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at  4:10 PM UTC"},{"id":382828,"unique_id":"382828-4414","author":{"id":2507,"username":"dev_revs","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/3feb57900603446c9bbfd5fb40759f41?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"with his remakes of his avicus maps? \u0026lt;o/","body_tagged":"with his remakes of his avicus maps? \u0026lt;o/","created_at":"2017/10/15 22:31:03 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at 10:10 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":382814,"unique_id":"382814-4271","author":{"id":270551,"username":"zicuri","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/004e817d35fa47aeac7e4f37d70ed9ba?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#009396","staff":true},"body":"Fouled is on Badlion, it's a gg sorry guys","body_tagged":"Fouled is on Badlion, it's a gg sorry guys","created_at":"2017/10/15 15:50:54 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at  3:10 PM UTC"}},{"id":382831,"unique_id":"382831-1778","author":{"id":557615,"username":"poofywoo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/a88ba5b5e22845929006afd467248a2b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Good prize pools that are motivational","body_tagged":"Good prize pools that are motivational","created_at":"2017/10/15 23:06:51 +0000","created_at_human":"October 15, 2017 at 11:10 PM UTC"},{"id":382856,"unique_id":"382856-2588","author":{"id":386981,"username":"Nitido","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/81f52f6fa3364a4589c7848e0fbf5f00?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"my team play tournaments. :D","body_tagged":"my team play tournaments. :D","created_at":"2017/10/16 20:54:45 +0000","created_at_human":"October 16, 2017 at  8:10 PM UTC"},{"id":382894,"unique_id":"382894-3201","author":{"id":193218,"username":"ImRaging","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/fb4900805ca04f6597ccf62d1468b193?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":true},"body":"A lot of old players like myself have lost interest in avicus and simply dont snjoy the game itself anymore, let alone avicus.
