Meaning there will be 4 different groups of maps, and these will be called\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eWaves\u003c/b\u003e. Each Wave will be comprised of 11 different maps and if you play a certain wave, you'll most likely encounter maps from that small group of 11, while the rest of waves contain the other 33.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe group of servers from SG07 to SG12 will be called\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eFirst Wave\u003c/b\u003e.

Well, these are called\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eUniversal Wave\u003c/b\u003e. And these group of servers will contain every single map from the Survival Games repository, making it possible for you to enjoy any of the 44 maps in that group of servers.
