This is probably the most STUPID thing I've ever seen. Can someone please explain to me how mods determine whether players or hacking or not because so far I've been kicked for spawn blocking when I was guarding the monument. Kicked for targeting because I was killing the same person that kept going for our monument. And lastly temp banned by DoctaPop for kill aura just because some guy said I had hacks it in the chat then reported me? How in the world is this fair? Not only is this just stupid but its highly unlikely for me to be hacking. One I don't even know how to get hacks. {PS IM 13 YEARS OLD} Secondly I play on a mac, the worst type of computer. Lastly if you look at my stats Im not that good compared to other people on this server. When Im typing this I am ranked 78th place for kills on the leader board so Im pretty decent at PvP but there is times when I just get REKT by other people. So if any mods can tell me how you determine if people are hacking please tell me I'm just curious and this event has just be bothering me for the last couple of days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e{Check my profile if you don't believe me}","body_tagged":"On August third I was temp banned by DoctaPop for \"Hacking-Kill Aura\".
