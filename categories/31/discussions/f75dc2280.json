The reason Avicus tourneys have been increasing in size as of recently is because you're just now tapping into the huge playerbase of people who loved team based 8v8 minecraft (ocn) and like playing in 1.7, the objectively best version for pvp. In 1.8, your crosshair lags behind where it is alleged to be by a few miliseconds, and the laundrylist of unplayable features and bugs added in 1.9 will not only take more dev time to remove than it did to make all of atlas, but even then at the very best you can only achieve a quazi 1.7 pvp hybrid where you're neither appeasing the people who want a real 1.7 pvp experience, or the 1.9 purists who I assume you're trying to attract with this move.
