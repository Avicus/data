However, I'm changing back to my original scientist looking skin. Anyways... Has anyone on avicus created a new skin for themselves? Another question I have for you guys is if anyone has a new nickname for themselves. This could be relating to your name or something that you are good at, retaining to avicus topic. For example my nickname(s) include: Canuck, Pro, socks. Yes socks. I used to be called socks for some reason back when I played sports. Don't ask why. Oh and sorry if this seems a bit late for a \"new year\" post, but whatever!
