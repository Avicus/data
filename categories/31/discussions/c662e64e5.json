Through playing on Avicus, I was able to connect with many players and in the future, I hope to have at least a coffee with some of those closer friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Bringing joy to others: Although it's probably nothing compared to volunteering in the real world, it still felt nice when you know you made a difference in someone else's life whether it be one less hacker, or helping someone break the monument.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) My grammar improved: Before Avicus, I felt as if I never knew where to place commas. For reasons unknown to me, it has miraculously improved and helped me in school tremendously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) I learned how to build a computer: Thanks to\u0026nbsp;{tag=dd725af0c6604eb6be334aca40897048} and\u0026nbsp;{tag=f922df68879a40758b8e086d313325bb}, I was able to build a decent gaming computer for under $150. They also helped me to understand how to actually build it, and here I am now able to build computers on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) I improved my social skills: Through talking to hundreds of people on Avicus, I was able to become more of a social person in the real world. Things such as moderator interviews and community discussions helped me get over my fear of public speaking.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6) Able to keep up with the news without actually watching it: Thank you to whoever posted some big news stories in the discord/forums. It kept me informed when I was too lazy to watch the news on TV.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7) Improved organizational skills: Through the creation of several spreadsheets and documents, I feel as if my skills in organization have improved for thede programs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8) I was never bored during school: I would always have something new to check whether it was a new forum post or some new messages in slack, skype, or discord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9) Helped me through tough times: Often times, my Mom would yell at me for the most minor things, and people usually feel pretty bad when that happens. I used Avicus as a way to help me through those times and have fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10) Realization towards my career goal: I'm now a senior in high school, and it was only this year when I sort of had a sense of what kind of career I wanted to have. Through officiating and commentating during Avicus tournaments while observing the Counter-Strike scene, I realized I wanted a career in E-sports. Whether it is as an analyst, a planner, or even a club owner, I'm not sure, but what I do know is that Avicus helped me to realize this. Whether I achieve that goal is another question, but I guess I will have to wait and see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease share your experiences!
