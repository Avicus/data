You are selectively banning as well, not only is that unprofessional but is just wrong. Also to begin with why do you have to ban? I get people are upset about spoilers to the new Star Wars movie. But can you not just mute them and call it a day? What the hell are you accomplishing by banning them? Asserting your dominance over them in a minecraft pvp setting is a very productive use of your time i suppose. There is no point to banning these people, you guys look ridiculous if you do so. So please, try not to be complete idiots. Also if any staff gets demoted for posting spoilers that is absolutely idiotic. The fact that this is an issue is the reason why many don't play avicus.
