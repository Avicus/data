Well it's an obvious fact that water cooling will give you more overclocking headroom and keep your components cool. If you want to, going for a custom loop and cool your GPU, CPU, Motherboard, Ram, whatever, will be more effective than getting an all in one, say the Corsair H110i. But, if you don't need to cool your cards, or anything of that sort, only your CPU... an AIO (All In One) Water Cooler is fine. If you're getting an i7 3rd - 6th Gen, i definitely recommend a water cooling solution. Really easy to install and it will again, give you overclocking headroom. I don't recommend a custom loop for starters. It's just going to be frustrating, and it will cost a lot more than an AIO. But what about air cooling? It's slightly easier to install compared to a Corsair, Coolermaster, etc. cooler. But once again, I wouldn't cheap out on the cooling system if you're going to be recording, editing, overclocking, etc. with an i7.

NVidea dominates the market and are able to pull of tricks to keep them in the lead and don't have to make the best GPU for the money. there is also the case of the 3.5GBS of usable VRAM on the 970 instead of it's advertised 4. Although it was just a miscommunication they never mentioned the fact that the last 512mb was very slow and basically useless until it was discovered and made a big deal. AMD is better in both performance and morale, just a little less efficient (that was a lot longer than planned)","created_at":"2015/12/07 07:14:28 +0000","created_at_human":"December  7, 2015 at  7:12 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":255365,"unique_id":"255365-969","author":{"id":5141,"username":"Sevoo","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/0f2408c6b4554076a115d9ea6c81a335?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I still think the 4790K would be a better choice, but I can agree on the PSU.
