It's simply tiring. \u003cbr\u003eAvicus slowly takes over the life you are living. And this is not something positive.\u003cbr\u003eAnd since you put soo much effort into that, you automatically expect something in return. That is normal and good. And most of the time you get some thank you's when you ban a hacker and you are motivated to keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd then\u003c/b\u003e...\u003cbr\u003e... you see such a thread.\u003cbr\u003eWhy should I carry on? I come on the server, the TS regularly. I'm active on the forums, like handling reports or appeals and people can always contact me on slack. What am I doing wrong to get such a thread \"\u003ci\u003eWhere is staff? Maldives?\u003c/i\u003e\"? It's almost insulting. And I believe I'm not the only moderator that thinks like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes there aren't always mods on. Reasons for that is their actual life outside of avicus. They still come on the server and moderate, help people out and they should be demoted because they aren't online when you see a hacker?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow onto the thing about adding more mods. If there were more mod candidates, then we would already notice them. Applications aren't the only way to get new moderators, but people have to meet specific requirements...\u003cbr\u003eApplications wouldn't help with this that much either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen why don't we lower the requirements? Because why don't throw the rank at everyone?\u003cbr\u003eIt would make the moderator rank less valuable. Something that would be very counterproductive in light of the staff team's past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually I'm on LOA rightnow because I need a break from everything that is happening right now. I need a break to find avicus' spark again. Also my marks dropped a bit xD","created_at":"2016/11/19 21:25:51 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at  9:11 PM UTC"}},{"id":343026,"unique_id":"343026-3663","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Stop stealing my reports vlad!\u003cbr\u003eI want to pass my Jr.Mod trial too!!","body_tagged":"Stop stealing my reports vlad!\u003cbr\u003eI want to pass my Jr.Mod trial too!!","created_at":"2016/11/19 22:49:29 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at 10:11 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":342985,"unique_id":"342985-90","author":{"id":245659,"username":"vladthegreat100","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0657f906e1f29521397b9adcaac4a5fc?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"Ah, I remember the good old days where staff would be trying to\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003enot\u003c/b\u003e steal all the reports because there were so many staff online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuch great memories\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#2014avicusmemories","body_tagged":"Ah, I remember the good old days where staff would be trying to\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003enot\u003c/b\u003e steal all the reports because there were so many staff online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuch great memories\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#2014avicusmemories","created_at":"2016/11/19 15:21:09 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at  3:11 PM UTC"}},{"id":343028,"unique_id":"343028-293","author":{"id":245659,"username":"vladthegreat100","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0657f906e1f29521397b9adcaac4a5fc?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"/s Does anyone want to take that report\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eBlank Chat\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/s SHIT, STAFF CHAT BROKE, GOTTA RELOG","body_tagged":"/s Does anyone want to take that report\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eBlank Chat\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/s SHIT, STAFF CHAT BROKE, GOTTA RELOG","created_at":"2016/11/19 23:28:49 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at 11:11 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":343026,"unique_id":"343026-778","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Stop stealing my reports vlad!\u003cbr\u003eI want to pass my Jr.Mod trial too!!","body_tagged":"Stop stealing my reports vlad!\u003cbr\u003eI want to pass my Jr.Mod trial too!!","created_at":"2016/11/19 22:49:29 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at 10:11 PM UTC"}},{"id":343038,"unique_id":"343038-1714","author":{"id":299792,"username":"SnowSX3","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"#FF5C5C","staff":true},"body":"Wow, reports are really quiet today.\u003cbr\u003e----\u003cbr\u003esees fly hacker with zero reports\u003cbr\u003e----\u003cbr\u003e/s Staff chat broke, gonna relog guys.","body_tagged":"Wow, reports are really quiet today.\u003cbr\u003e----\u003cbr\u003esees fly hacker with zero reports\u003cbr\u003e----\u003cbr\u003e/s Staff chat broke, gonna relog guys.","created_at":"2016/11/19 23:59:36 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at 11:11 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":343028,"unique_id":"343028-3256","author":{"id":245659,"username":"vladthegreat100","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0657f906e1f29521397b9adcaac4a5fc?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#5D5D5D","staff":false},"body":"/s Does anyone want to take that report\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eBlank Chat\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/s SHIT, STAFF CHAT BROKE, GOTTA RELOG","body_tagged":"/s Does anyone want to take that report\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eBlank Chat\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/s SHIT, STAFF CHAT BROKE, GOTTA RELOG","created_at":"2016/11/19 23:28:49 +0000","created_at_human":"November 19, 2016 at 11:11 PM UTC"}},{"id":343059,"unique_id":"343059-1151","author":{"id":164597,"username":"Eklip_Z","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/701d4173324b474c931a16529d696967?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"2014?
