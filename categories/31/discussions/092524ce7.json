Let's just hope they have a sense of humor. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have quite a few scary stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlrighty, I am considered a bad kid, but not at school. People commonly mistake me as a goody two shoes. I wish I were.\u003cbr\u003eOne night, I was gonna meet up with some friends, but we could only meet at night. I snuck out and met them in an alley way. We were all there, and we ran to do some stuff. As we were passing through a graveyard (sorry, it's rude ;_; but we didn't step on graves or anything.) I was sprinting when all of a sudden, I was tripped, and felt pressure on the back of my shoulders, like I was being grabbed. I cried for help, my friends arrived. I looked over to my left, at a gravestone. It said \"R******* *****\", (censored for privacy) an old student at my school. This student was my bully, he grabbed me a lot when he was alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'll tell more if you want some. I have quite a few.","created_at":"2014/07/20 11:44:50 +0000","created_at_human":"July 20, 2014 at 11:07 AM UTC"}},{"id":44498,"unique_id":"44498-1153","author":{"id":103,"username":"Shoto_","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/c959860f3ff34258b68d2a9e4541572f?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Sure if you want. :)","body_tagged":"Sure if you want. :)","created_at":"2014/07/20 12:06:54 +0000","created_at_human":"July 20, 2014 at 12:07 PM UTC","reply_to":{"id":44497,"unique_id":"44497-1894","author":{"id":178682,"username":"Dawudis","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/3066b7b943f84adaa6574e683acf31f2?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Could I use that in my horror stories, that is pretty scary :)","body_tagged":"Could I use that in my horror stories, that is pretty scary :)","created_at":"2014/07/20 12:04:53 +0000","created_at_human":"July 20, 2014 at 12:07 PM UTC"}},{"id":44500,"unique_id":"44500-2660","author":{"id":178682,"username":"Dawudis","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/3066b7b943f84adaa6574e683acf31f2?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"The scariest thing that ever happened to me was a long story, for about 4 years!!!
