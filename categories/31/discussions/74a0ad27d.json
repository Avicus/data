CTH is a great game and Nexus is a great game, but both together is not so good. The gameplay is different aslo. The point is to defend the middle and score points there. Nexus is to kill everyone to win. There is a big different. I love CTH and Nexus, but I would hate it if they are together...","created_at":"2014/08/18 16:55:13 +0000","created_at_human":"August 18, 2014 at  4:08 PM UTC"}},{"id":69511,"unique_id":"69511-1870","author":{"id":2580,"username":"MLG_Jirafa","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/4b5cc2436683443c890105db16fe4e0a?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Nebula: It's great as it is now, maybe change the rots a little bit with the new maps\u003cbr\u003eNexus: add more maps, but it's great\u003cbr\u003eWalls: never played it so I dunno what to say\u003cbr\u003eElimination: Keep it all like the same but change the name to SG\u003cbr\u003eCTH: allow us to join in the middle of a match without being donators","body_tagged":"Nebula: It's great as it is now, maybe change the rots a little bit with the new maps\u003cbr\u003eNexus: add more maps, but it's great\u003cbr\u003eWalls: never played it so I dunno what to say\u003cbr\u003eElimination: Keep it all like the same but change the name to SG\u003cbr\u003eCTH: allow us to join in the middle of a match without being donators","created_at":"2014/08/21 02:31:08 +0000","created_at_human":"August 21, 2014 at  2:08 AM UTC"},{"id":69515,"unique_id":"69515-2051","author":{"id":6361,"username":"Emmaye","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abed267c620d5e6347952892f3431f7b?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Turn Elimination into SG please","body_tagged":"Turn Elimination into SG please","created_at":"2014/08/21 02:45:44 +0000","created_at_human":"August 21, 2014 at  2:08 AM UTC"},{"id":69519,"unique_id":"69519-2635","author":{"id":348565,"username":"kobetexas","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/36ccbe3e115940eca677e4af288d088c?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"Ehh, SG sounds better :) ^^^","body_tagged":"Ehh, SG sounds better :) ^^^","created_at":"2014/08/21 03:06:28 +0000","created_at_human":"August 21, 2014 at  3:08 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":69515,"unique_id":"69515-937","author":{"id":6361,"username":"Emmaye","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abed267c620d5e6347952892f3431f7b?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"Turn Elimination into SG please","body_tagged":"Turn Elimination into SG please","created_at":"2014/08/21 02:45:44 +0000","created_at_human":"August 21, 2014 at  2:08 AM UTC"}},{"id":69565,"unique_id":"69565-3966","author":{"id":2917,"username":"garrett_m_s","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/a40154404e024745916c0d01e2df264a?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"One idea i have thought of is kind of like what mineplex does(hate to bring other servers up).

Avicus should throw maps from all 6 game modes combining them into an arcade like thing where everyone can play all maps. I think this sounds right.
