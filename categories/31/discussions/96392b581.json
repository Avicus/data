He helps me through every tough situation I get into, and I help him with anything he needs. He has become like a long lost cousin of some sort, but I feel as though he is part of my family. Eric not only cares for me, but also makes sure I dont get ignored when we are in group chats. Eric has been one of my best friends, ever, real life or MC.

He also helped me enter the PvP world and helped me become better when I first started, I could write books about jozz, but I could write books about everything, so thank you SO SO SO much jozz.

Now that your leaving i feel terrible because there are so many things that i needed to get straight with you and that i needed to prove to you. Just to show that i am not just some cocky little kid who talks behind your back. Now your leaving just churns me up because the disgusting impression that i have left on you as you leave is going to remain stuck forever. So i would like to once again apologize for any thing i have ever done to hurt you in any way. In the future i wanted to show that i could be better than i have shown. That i am not just an obnoxious dick. So i am sincerely truly sorry that you are going. Everyone on Avicus always has a good thing to say about you and in retrospect you seem like a fun, interesting, responsible, clever and overall a great guy that  i greatly regret being unpleasant towards. I am sure you will go great, well earned places in life; me and the entirety of Avicus thank you for benefitting the community in such a large way. I hope you can accept my apology. So much respect, good luck and good bye Yoavkipper. bmbrocks321","created_at":"2014/08/23 22:12:04 +0000","created_at_human":"August 23, 2014 at 10:08 PM UTC"},{"id":70997,"unique_id":"70997-4130","author":{"id":108,"username":"MLGtino","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5855cb2b462f42969c1e685db0ecd987?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"To start off, I want to say that I really understand your message.

To this day, that card and model still lies next to my bed.
