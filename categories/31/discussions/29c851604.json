are some recommended animes for you to take a look at.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSword Art Online-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eAs stated before, yes this is a very overrated anime and imo its pretty bad (as in story plot wise) but other than that, it is a pretty enjoyable anime (depending on how you look on it)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAttack on Titan\u003c/b\u003e- Bit bloody and gorey but if oyur k with that, this anime is right for you. It is not overrated to an extent but its still pretty cool and enjoyable to watch. You might hate the main character and some characters are flat in the series but its great though. Another problem is there is a lot of plot holes (but reading the manga does fill up some plot holes but even the manga itself makes up more plot holes -_-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eFMA Brotherhood (Fullmetal Alchemist) -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eOne of the classics and argueably the best animes. PRetty dope story plot and I guarantee you will enjoy this if your in to action\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eNisekoi-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eNisekoi is a romance/harem anime that it is a pretty enjoyable anime to watch. Very funny anime to watch but its plot kinda is bad because there is A LOT of fillers and the plot seems to get nowhere. Just a heads up\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAngelBeats-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eSort of overrated anime but Imo, its better than SAO. Pretty sad in the end and it is a shame it lasted 12 episodes but the plot is really good. ITs funny, theres action, feels, its a good starter anime imo. The only con i would give is the producers did not give as much episodes to futher develop their characters but pretty sick Anime\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eFairyTail-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eKinda long anime series (and still airing) but Fairy Tail is a great anime. IT is very funny, the plot is REALLY good. (Yes a bit repeptitve but hey its like 200 ep long so what do you expect :/) and you may get feels even just by listening to the soundtrack. Also, there is barely any fillers in this anime so good to watch. If you want to watch a long term anime series, go watch Fairy Tail (and i Highly suggest you read the manga)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnimes to stay away from till you already watched enough- Now I know, some of these animes I would list would be arguable but i put these because some viewers may not understand or get lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eClannad-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eClannad, IMO, is a very good anime, good romance and much feels (if your patient). I do not recommend this anime only if you do not want to watch long dialogues and you like face-paced shows\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eDaily Life of High School Boys-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eIT is a pretty hilarious anime as it shows a daily life of a high school boy. This anime is an iffy because if you were to watch this and this would be the first time watching anime , you \u0026nbsp;most likely get lost and not get the jokes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eMy Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eGood anime series but you might not get it. Idk its optional\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eLucky Star-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e^same reason stated above\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eNaruto-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eITs your choice but it is REALLLY Long so watch it if your patient. Still good though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eOne Piece-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e^again\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eSchool Days-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eyou will see why\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eBoko no Pico-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eSTAY AWAY (but som r8's 11/10 4 dank memes) (also its a hentai)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is my suggestions of some animes.

It is not overrated to an extent but its still pretty cool and enjoyable to watch. You might hate the main character and some characters are flat in the series but its great though. Another problem is there is a lot of plot holes (but reading the manga does fill up some plot holes but even the manga itself makes up more plot holes -_-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eFMA Brotherhood (Fullmetal Alchemist) -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eOne of the classics and argueably the best animes. PRetty dope story plot and I guarantee you will enjoy this if your in to action\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eNisekoi-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eNisekoi is a romance/harem anime that it is a pretty enjoyable anime to watch. Very funny anime to watch but its plot kinda is bad because there is A LOT of fillers and the plot seems to get nowhere. Just a heads up\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAngelBeats-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eSort of overrated anime but Imo, its better than SAO. Pretty sad in the end and it is a shame it lasted 12 episodes but the plot is really good. ITs funny, theres action, feels, its a good starter anime imo. The only con i would give is the producers did not give as much episodes to futher develop their characters but pretty sick Anime\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eFairyTail-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eKinda long anime series (and still airing) but Fairy Tail is a great anime. IT is very funny, the plot is REALLY good. (Yes a bit repeptitve but hey its like 200 ep long so what do you expect :/) and you may get feels even just by listening to the soundtrack. Also, there is barely any fillers in this anime so good to watch. If you want to watch a long term anime series, go watch Fairy Tail (and i Highly suggest you read the manga)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnimes to stay away from till you already watched enough- Now I know, some of these animes I would list would be arguable but i put these because some viewers may not understand or get lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eClannad-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eClannad, IMO, is a very good anime, good romance and much feels (if your patient). I do not recommend this anime only if you do not want to watch long dialogues and you like face-paced shows\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eDaily Life of High School Boys-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eIT is a pretty hilarious anime as it shows a daily life of a high school boy. This anime is an iffy because if you were to watch this and this would be the first time watching anime , you \u0026nbsp;most likely get lost and not get the jokes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eMy Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eGood anime series but you might not get it.
