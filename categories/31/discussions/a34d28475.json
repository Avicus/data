They made a statement which was \"Show me proof the community wants this\". I then collected statements from over 60 avicus regulars and for the majority tournament competitors who stated that they wanted all officials demoted and for interviews to be given to new prospects as well as the old officials; this list included 4 officials. Ethan then contacted me and we held another meeting in which he asked me who should be demoted, because we both agreed there were some good officials. \u003cbr\u003eThe two of us and michael then decided on a good list of officials. The list was: Sli, Seth, Javi, Robo, Tazz, Jive, Michael. Michael was told he would be head official. The day of the officials' demotion came and as I watched them drop off the staff page I was suprised to see robo go. At this point I got in a call with robo and told him I would get him his position back. After talking to Ethan he did indeed grant robo his position back but also promoted both himself and Jozz to the position, which had never been discussed or agreed upon. Ethan also left people such as Vobaseball and Pelpel in the official slack which bred anti-Michael sentiments. Michael later told me he felt his reign as Head official would be ineffective due to these feelings and thought it would be better to retire as \u0026nbsp;to allow the other officials to do their job unhindered.\u003cbr\u003eEthan later decided he wanted to work with the officials on a smoother level so he gave them the ability to vote him and the rest officials (both demoted and current) back in or out of position. These votes were run by ethan and in order for an official (many of which held other staff positions) to vote against him they would have to directly confront an administrator of a server and tell him they wanted him demoted, not to mention this same administrator had just demoted several of their fellow officials. These re-votes led to the return of GrapeSmoothie and Vobaseball along with justifying Ethan's position along with the positions of those who he promoted: Seth and Jozz. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I know Ethan is Hitler'ing the server but I can't do anything about it\" -Peachy when he was Admin","body_tagged":"To clarify for people I will recount my experience in this situation that I find relevant.\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I had a meeting with Peachy and Ethan in which I requested the demotion of all officials. They made a statement which was \"Show me proof the community wants this\". I then collected statements from over 60 avicus regulars and for the majority tournament competitors who stated that they wanted all officials demoted and for interviews to be given to new prospects as well as the old officials; this list included 4 officials. Ethan then contacted me and we held another meeting in which he asked me who should be demoted, because we both agreed there were some good officials. \u003cbr\u003eThe two of us and michael then decided on a good list of officials. The list was: Sli, Seth, Javi, Robo, Tazz, Jive, Michael. Michael was told he would be head official. The day of the officials' demotion came and as I watched them drop off the staff page I was suprised to see robo go. At this point I got in a call with robo and told him I would get him his position back. After talking to Ethan he did indeed grant robo his position back but also promoted both himself and Jozz to the position, which had never been discussed or agreed upon. Ethan also left people such as Vobaseball and Pelpel in the official slack which bred anti-Michael sentiments. Michael later told me he felt his reign as Head official would be ineffective due to these feelings and thought it would be better to retire as \u0026nbsp;to allow the other officials to do their job unhindered.\u003cbr\u003eEthan later decided he wanted to work with the officials on a smoother level so he gave them the ability to vote him and the rest officials (both demoted and current) back in or out of position. These votes were run by ethan and in order for an official (many of which held other staff positions) to vote against him they would have to directly confront an administrator of a server and tell him they wanted him demoted, not to mention this same administrator had just demoted several of their fellow officials. These re-votes led to the return of GrapeSmoothie and Vobaseball along with justifying Ethan's position along with the positions of those who he promoted: Seth and Jozz. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I know Ethan is Hitler'ing the server but I can't do anything about it\" -Peachy when he was Admin","created_at":"2016/05/12 00:20:22 +0000","created_at_human":"May 12, 2016 at 12:05 AM UTC"},{"id":301384,"unique_id":"301384-2418","author":{"id":31238,"username":"steven5703","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c3bf955b7bb3ae09c8e764b913666b2?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;\"\u003eI appreciate your feedback on the choices that they made, but I do not\u0026nbsp;appreciate you making false claims, thanks.\u003c/span\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;\"\u003eI appreciate your feedback on the choices that they made, but I do not\u0026nbsp;appreciate you making false claims, thanks.\u003c/span\u003e","created_at":"2016/05/12 00:38:22 +0000","created_at_human":"May 12, 2016 at 12:05 AM UTC","reply_to":{"id":301376,"unique_id":"301376-1466","author":{"id":314055,"username":"DonaldMyTrump","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e24b919fc04a2852c070e8c53558c93?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"To clarify for people I will recount my experience in this situation that I find relevant.\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I had a meeting with Peachy and Ethan in which I requested the demotion of all officials.
