Keep in mind that this post is just composed of trends I have noticed and these are just my opinions. Please do not start any flame wars here. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eRecap:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026nbsp;think a few of you may remember when we started that \"push\" on one of the voting websites. There wasn't any obvious impact however, a few days after people started to vote, Avicus surpassed 200 players on at one time. I believe this is the most Avicus has had for months. Unfortunately, that was a 1 day thing and now we are back to the average of 150 at the peak point. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if people are encouraged enough to vote, Avicus will slowly regain some players. An incentive such as credits will definitely improve the server's ranking and player base. Special thanks to every one who had voted then. I'm pretty sure that most of us (including myself) has lost the incentive by now and that's fine.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMap Development I'd say is doing very well. With the newfound use of Trello, map submissions and map statuses have been more organized then ever before. In addition, the Contest Committee has found a few new members. Hopefully some more cool ideas will be discussed. Even if you aren't in the committee, don't be afraid to voice your suggestions! I think that the maps on Avicus are what keeps some people here. The original gameplay of the classics and the jaw-dropping views of castles are simply stunning. 1 suggestion I have is to sort the DTM rotations, (excluding Mix) by player limit. If you play a Senex 1 match right after a Clay Wars match, you'll end up with about 30 spectators. Just something to keep in mind. I might suggest a custom rotation later on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAvicus is becoming more competitive! Although sometimes you may not think it is, especially when people cover the monument, more people know what they are doing! Defenses are becoming stronger and people are grasping a better knowledge of defending and attacking. Every Clay Wars match I see always gathers 50+ players with tons of people on defense. Even if the people defending are not \"professionals\" or what not, pretty much everybody knows to dig to bedrock. Teams better be searching for some new recruits!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community is getting closer! Back then when you hop on the forums, you always see the same names. I'm glad to say that I see names I don't recognize on the forums. After the message about applying for staff was introduced in-game, I know for a fact that a few people saw that message and got the incentive to join the forums. More messages like these will attract an even bigger audience. On another note, I see some more staff communicating with the community which is a good thing. All the complaints we had before are slowly starting to decrease. When people cannot give as many complaints, you know that something is being done right!\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RedRover/Mega/Pickup Scrimmages have been a blast! To twist things up, teams have been mixing their players to create new teams. You get a good experience by working with other players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Avicus Social Media is active!
