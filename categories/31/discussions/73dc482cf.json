Usually when people say that it's in offensive context, or if it's by itself its intended to troll. If someone's is saying \"my n-word\" then they're most likely not trying to offend anyone, and I'll tell them to keep chat appropriate, and ask the person they were talking to if they were offended. Like I said, we adapt, and realize that different uses call for different responses.","created_at":"2017/01/09 20:12:52 +0000","created_at_human":"January  9, 2017 at  8:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":352163,"unique_id":"352163-2906","author":{"id":552306,"username":"Avys","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5cc80cab971c49c180ffd5df3d5d9c52?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I could just be sharing my soft, tender, moist memes.","body_tagged":"I could just be sharing my soft, tender, moist memes.","created_at":"2017/01/09 21:41:47 +0000","created_at_human":"January  9, 2017 at  9:01 PM UTC"},{"id":352165,"unique_id":"352165-3972","author":{"id":354547,"username":"BoldAndBrash","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/5a0b55defddb448caf5070856cbf39ee?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"Gray","staff":true},"body":"got me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e@OP I punish racism depending on the severity of the comment; I kick if it's a comment such as somebody calling another user a nigger, and give a tempban if it's worse.

Some meanings are unclear, and the guidelines are very broad that don't cover context. However, we need to ensure that the chat is friendly and safe for everyone as we cannot assume their race, gender or beliefs.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for suicide encouragement, we strictly do not tolerate behaviour where someone may feel threatened - even in the slightest - or uncomfortable with the environment they are put in. Saying to someone \"it is the internet, get over it\", is very dismissive and ignorant to people who are suffering from larger problems then we are. We are unable to understand what they are going through, because we aren't experiencing it. Playing Minecraft or browsing the internet may be their escape from the troubles.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are willing to hear what everyone else is saying, but please do not complain about a punishment you have received in the past.","created_at":"2017/01/10 13:00:32 +0000","created_at_human":"January 10, 2017 at  1:01 PM UTC"}},{"id":352290,"unique_id":"352290-4587","author":{"id":192491,"username":"PieZ","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/408727ad9deed8682820a40290ffe516?s=$SIZE$\u0026default=mm","color":"#006BD2","staff":true},"body":"Slurs in general is a topic that we need to fix up.

I really dont see why saying \"nigga\" or \"nigger\" is bannable. Especially when doing so in isolation, the same goes for any racist words. If someone is genuinely being racist than you can go ahead and ban them. Otherwise, just tell them to stop. I really dont see how hard it is to gauge if someone is being racist.","created_at":"2017/01/11 16:55:15 +0000","created_at_human":"January 11, 2017 at  4:01 PM UTC"},{"id":352460,"unique_id":"352460-650","author":{"id":419336,"username":"voidloop","avatar":"https://crafatar.com/avatars/7fd3b7f737e44c55a214878986207576?helm\u0026size=$SIZE$","color":"none","staff":false},"body":"I did get banned once for saying \"N**ga we made it by drake\" in chat, but got unbanned shortly after because they understood.
