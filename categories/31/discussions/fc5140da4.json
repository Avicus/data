That being said, BC should have also made sure that all mods they were using were indeed legal. I also believe the tournament rules, mod restrictions and other such details should have been better handled by the officials and presented in a more organized and team friendly way. In my opinion keeping up with the tournament, it's updates and such was all a major bust. However there is no point whining about what has already happened. I think there should be an elected official who is in charge of presentation of the tournament on the forums. I also think that once a team registers for the tournament there should be a way of receiving messages about updates (through the player's alert page) notifying them of these things so that there is no excuse to miss it. Also if there is going to be the huge amount of different forum threads that tournament announcements are made across there needs to at least be one hub thread where users can navigate to the others. Also announcements should never be made on individual posts on threads.","body_tagged":"Here's my take: BC would have won the game regardless.
