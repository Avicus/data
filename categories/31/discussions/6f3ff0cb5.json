discord might be a better option is because they have like ten times as many users as slack so it'll probably have a little more staying power","body_tagged":"reminder that these so-called \"valuations\" are nothing but guesses since slack isn't a publicly traded company\u003cbr\u003ealso reminder that revenue\u0026nbsp;≠ profit, all we know is that they made \"around\" 64 mil (another guess), no idea what their operating expenses are like and how much money they took home at the end of the day\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand just for the record, i dislike both slack and discord equally. i would prefer to just use irc but tragically that seems to be a sinking ship since it's no longer hip with the kids. the only reason i mentioned jumping ship to discord might be a better

on the company's current assets or revenue, it is based on how well all the VCs think it's gonna do in the future. of course, everyone knows how far along we are when it comes to predicting the future (remember the election?), not to mention that VCs have been wrong in a big way in the past, and specifically about internet companies (remember the dot com bubble?) if the valuation is rising, it may just mean that there's less of the company for each VC to grab so they gotta fork over more for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei'm sure many people will agree that 64 million is a lot, but it's important to remember that it's just revenue, not profit. if we factor in employee compensation, it shrinks pretty fast. the average salary in california for software developers is 100k, and if we assume that to be the average salary at slack (which it probably isn't, considering that not everyone who works there is a software developer, but then again san francisco has an extremely high cost of living so the salaries are likely higher across the board, and we can't forget that there's probably quite a few executives making significantly more) and multiply it by the number of employees (700), you get 70 million in employee compensation alone, not factoring in other costs such as equipment and whatnot.","body_tagged":"shocking that the king of dictionary-pounding got a definition
