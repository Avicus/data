Why make something only x amount of \"famous\" Avicus players can enjoy rather than play on a well developed server with loads of other people? I mean if you want a private match, you'd might as well be asking for a YML plugin. Anyways if we want to see the best Avicus players play against each other, wait for the tourney and the two teams in the finals clearly, and fairly, make themselves the best players on Avicus going against each other in a game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow this does bring up some interesting things. Tourneys in other gamemodes? Hell yeah I'm all for that. I'd love to see a Nebula TDM tourney. But for the most part, I'm just putting in my feedback. It's my personal opinion, just putting it out there :)\u003c/span\u003e","body_tagged":"\u003cspan\u003eI'm gonna be 100% honest and as serious as physically possible with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a good idea if executed correctly. But the problem is that trying to make this into something that isn't a disaster is damn near impossible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Where the hell are we going to choose the \"best\" players? We can't have community or staff vote because practically everyone is going to vote for their friends or someone within the top 15 or 20 on the leaderboards. Let's face it, a good portion of people up there aren't the greatest souls living on this planet (some others are, not saying everyone up there is \"bad\"). Picking players is going to be a combination of bias and players running on about \"why wasn't I picked???\". That's why we have Avicus teams, that way everything is fair and even for the most part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Who's gonna host this? Where is all of this going to take place? I'd rather we put hours on end into developing an actually tourney rather than something else of inferior caliber.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Many people I'm sure (me included) have thought about this before. But before we suggest something too boldly, must must take a step back and ask ourselves... why? Sure it'll be fun, but why not just play the game?
